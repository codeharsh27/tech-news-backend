Couldn\u2019t make it? The images below offer a glimpse into what you missed. Untilnext year. Vinod Khosla, telling attendees he doesn\u2019t buy the argument that powering AI will doom climate efforts. Geothermal energy is nearly here, he said, while fusion remains further out. He also touched on his alignment with President Donald Trump (deregulation) and his disagreement (immigration): \u201cThe only thing I will say is this administration won\u2019t last forever,\u201d he said with a grin. That\u2019s Roelof Botha on the stage, and that\u2019s the crowd that came to hang on his every word. The Sequoia partner talked through how his firm picks winners, what government ownership in startups could mean, and warned founders not to get cute with timing, telling them to raise now if they\u2019ll need money six months from now. Bubbles pop. Kevin Damoa of Gl\u012bd Technologies, winner of this year\u2019s Battlefield competition, with Battlefield chief Isabelle Johannessen. She and TC\u2019s Michael Schick work with many dozens of startups for months to prepare them for this stage. The hug is earned. Roy Lee, the founder of Cluely, the app best known for its mantra \u201ccheat at everything,\u201d entertains the crowd with his f-bomb-laden take on how to win at marketing. \u201cEvery day, people are doing crazier and crazier things, which is why to stand out, you have to do something even crazier.\u201d (Pictured left, Maxwell Zeff, holding his own.) If former Cleveland Cavalier Tristan Thompson misses the NBA, he\u2019s not showing it. He\u2019s building a business empire and raising pointed questions about the league he left behind. When asked about whether players could manipulate Basketball Fun \u2014 a web3 platform that turns NBA players into tradable tokens \u2014 he offered a counterpoint:\u201cIt\u2019s the same question we ask about referees. Are they not gaming the system?\u201dWhen moderator Rebecca Bellan pressed whether he meant NBA referees take bribes, Thompson shrugged.\u201cIt\u2019s just a question to be asked,\u201d he said. Our own Sean O\u2019Kane shares a moment with Wayve co-founder and CEO, Alex Kendall. Kendall may also be smiling because his U.K.-based self-driving startup \u2014 whose software acts as \u201cbrains for cars\u201d \u2014  is in talks to raise a fresh $2 billion from SoftBank and Microsoft at an $8 billion valuation. Phoebe Gates and Sophia Kianni, founders of the AI-powered shopping assistant Phia, dazzled the audience at TechCrunch with their enthusiasm for making high-quality, secondhand clothing a lot easier to find. Gates, daughter of Bill and Melinda, was also sporting when asked by moderator Amanda Silberling what her famous parents have learned from her. Said Gates with a laugh, \u201cHopefully style! I don\u2019t even consider myself that stylish; I just like building in the consumer space, but now I get random emails from my family, asking, \u2018Should I wear this to this?\u2019\u201d Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana with TechCrunch\u2019s Kirsten Korosec, fielding questions about autonomous vehicles, including whether society will accept deaths caused by self-driving cars. \u201cI think that society will,\u201d Mawakana said. \u201cThe challenge is making sure society has a high enough bar on safety that companies are held to.\u201d Kevin Rose talking Digg\u2019s reboot and the future of venture capital (Rose is also a general partner at the early-stage venture firm True Ventures). I\u2019m smiling because that\u2019s what you do when someone won\u2019t answer your questions about a buzzy, wearable startup that\u2019s still in stealth. (We\u2019ll have more onSandbarsoon.) Hugging Face co-founder Thomas Wolf hydrating between questions about building the future of AI, including as it relates to LeRobot, the Hugging Face project that\u2019s trying to democratize robotics with affordable hardware, open-source tools, and shared datasets. Finals judges Marlon Nichols of MaC VC and Aileen Lee of Cowboy Ventures during the last stages of our highly competitive Startup Battlefield. Somewhere off-camera, a founder is sweating through their pitch deck. Aaron Levie of Box in conversation with TC\u2019s Russell Brandom. Levie has graced the Disrupt stage numerous times over TC\u2019s 20 years at the center of the startup ecosystem, and he always brings it. Netflix CTO Elizabeth Stone on the streamer\u2019s expanded remit from simple binge-watching to interactive programming (think voting on live shows and gaming via your phone): \u201cIt hasn\u2019t changed the way we tell stories,\u201d she told a rapt crowd. TC\u2019s Dominic-Madori Davis talking community building with Tage Oyerinde of Campus, who\u2019s rethinking community college, and Teddy Solomon of Fizz, the anonymous social app that\u2019s spreading across college campuses and occasionally getting banned, which some might view as a badge of honor. A whiteboard of wants: developers needed, contacts offered, deals proposed. We love it when founders lean into old-school tactics. (Some still work!) David George, who leads the growth investing team at Andreessen Horowitz, came to the show to talk with Julie Bort about what startups need to weigh as they\u2019re eyeing the public market. It was his birthday, as it turns out; the crowd takes a moment here to celebrate it with him. Here\u2019sSan Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie discussing his call with President Trump regarding why not to send the National Guard to the city \u2014 a proposal floated by Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. \u201cWhat I said to him was what I say to everybody: this is a city on the rise,\u201d Lurie said.\u201cThree days of Disrupt here should prove that.\u201d On whether he made concessions with the deal-making Trump, he was definitive. \u201cNo, absolutely not. No ask.\u201d A lot of people come from around the world for programming about how to put their startups together. We covered all the bases on our Builders Stage, which was packed every day, all day.

    "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Most people tracking their health today end up with scattered clues. Their smartwatch shows sleep duration. A fitness app logs steps. A nutrition app counts calories. Yet few tools help people understand how all of this fits together. Bevel, a New York\u2013based startup, believes that\u2019s the missing piece in the shift toward proactive health. The company has raised a $10 million Series A from General Catalyst to scale its AI health companion, which unifies data from wearables and daily habits across sleep, fitness, and nutrition into personalized insights. The investment follows a breakout year for the two-year-old health tech company. Bevel says it has grown more than eightfold within the past year and now reaches over 100,000 daily active users, making it one of the fastest-growing health apps in the U.S. Additionally, the company says the average user opens the app eight times per day, and retention remains above 80% at 90 days \u2014 rare metrics in a category where people often churn after reaching a short-term fitness goal. \u201cWe think of health as a continuous journey, not a phase,\u201d said co-founder and CEOGrey Nguyenin an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cBevel meets you where you are, learns from your habits, and helps you make small changes that compound over time.\u201d But with so many health companion brands, fromWhooptoOuratoEight Sleep, why does the world need another one? According toAditya Agarwal, a Bevel co-founder and board member who is also a partner at venture firm South Park Commons, many of these health apps rely on accompanying hardware devices that customers must buy and maintain. Because such devices can be pricey, there\u2019s an opportunity to create a product that\u2019s purely software-based, giving people the flexibility to use the wearables they already own. \u201cA $500 ring or band is out of reach for a lot of people,\u201d said Agarwal. \u201c[People] already generate so much valuable health data from our primary wearables and other everyday sources. We wanted to make something that was more accessible across a much larger set of people.\u201d Bevel users pay $6 monthly or $50 annually. Unlike typical wellness apps that focus on a single area \u2014 such as steps, sleep, or nutrition \u2014 Bevel combines them into one experience. It integrates with Apple Watch and other popular wearables through Apple Health and directly syncs with continuous glucose monitors like Dexcom and Libre. Garmin and additional integrations are in development, the company said. All this information feeds into Bevel Intelligence, the company\u2019s core software, which analyzes and adapts recommendations to each user, learning how their body responds to stress, movement, or nutrition. Bevel\u2019s story started with pain \u2014 literally. Before starting the company in late 2023, Nguyen, who previously led products at Sam Altman\u2013backed Campus, and co-founder/CTOBen Yang, who worked on machine learning at Opendoor, were building stablecoin infrastructure for enterprises.\u00a0The demanding nature of startup life led Nguyen to neglect his health, and he developed chronic back pain that went undiagnosed for months despite using wearables and seeing doctors regularly. \u201cNothing pointed out what was actually causing my back pain, not even my doctors, which is crazy, right?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when this idea came up. Everyone\u2019s life is so nuanced. There are so many small things you do that stack on each other and, over time, create a chronic condition.\u201d Nguyen says he began piecing together his health data, tracking sleep, nutrition, and steps, and realized that issues across these areas had compounded over time. Low mobility from sitting too long, sleep problems caused by his mattress setup, and sodium-heavy meals that increased inflammation all played a role. Similarly, Agarwal, formerly CTO at Dropbox and an early engineer at Facebook, had gone through his own health overhaul after years of intense work left him burned out. What helped was logging his data manually \u2014 through spreadsheets and connected trackers \u2014 to rebuild his energy. When he connected with Yang and Nguyen about what they were building with Bevel, he saw they had a similar vision and joined the team as a co-founder and board member. \u201cWe shared the same North Star, which is helping people become more intelligent about their own health,\u201d said Agarwal, who is also a partner at South Park Commons. The venture capital firm, alongside General Catalyst, invested $4 million into Bevel earlier this year in a seed round. With fresh capital and no plans to develop its own wearables, Bevel intends to grow its team and expand into additional health services and partnerships that make proactive health accessible. \u201cBevel\u2019s mission to democratize health through intelligence and design deeply resonates with us,\u201d said Neeraj Arora, managing director at General Catalyst. \u201cThe level of engagement they\u2019re seeing from users is remarkable, and it\u2019s become part of people\u2019s daily lives \u2014 not just another app\u201d that they download and forget.

    "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Navan, the corporate travel and expense platform, finished its first day of trading on the Nasdaq on Thursday down 20% from its $25 IPO price, resulting in a valuation of approximately $4.7 billion for the 10-year-old company. The company was the first to use anew SEC rulethat allows public listings during a government shutdown. Unlike the traditional IPO path, which requires SEC regulators to review and grant final approval, companies using the shutdown workaround can get automatic approval for their IPO documents 20 days after submitting their price range, effectively bypassing the need for manual SEC approval. But the updated mechanism carries a risk: The government can scrutinize the documents later. If the SEC later finds material deficiencies or undisclosed issues, the company may be forced to amend its statements, which could lead to a lower stock price and even potential litigation. Despite this risk, Navan decided to proceed with its IPO, primarily because the bulk of its registration statements had already been reviewed by the SEC staff before the government shutdown began on October 1. The stock\u2019s initial decline is likely influenced, at least in part, by this regulatory uncertainty. The market\u2019s reaction to Navan\u2019s offering is being closely monitored by other IPO contenders. Startups looking to go public before the end of the year need to decide soon whether they\u2019re ready to deal with the regulatory unknowns or delay their filing until the next year. Navan has been waiting to go public for several years. The company reportedly filed itsconfidential IPO paperworkin 2022 and planned to debut at a $12 billion valuation in early 2023. The company, formerly known as TripActions, was last valued at$9.2 billionwhen it raised a $154 million Series G round in October 2022. Navan customers include Shopify, Zoom, Wayfair, OpenAI, and Thomson Reuters. The company claims that its AI-powered assistant, Ava, handles approximately 50% of customer conversations related to booking or changing flight, hotel, and car rental reservations. Navan\u2019s expense management solution helps companies manage employee expenses through features like automated receipt scanning and categorization. The company generated revenue of $613 million over the last 12 months (up 32%), with losses of $188 million, according toits S1. Navan\u2019s largest venture capital backers before its IPO included Lightspeed (holding a 24.8% stake), solo VC Oren Zeev (18.6% stake), Andreessen Horowitz (12.6%), and Greenoaks (7.1%).

The company also introduced new products and features, updates to its AI assistant, and the ability to use its spreadsheet tool alongside its app-building feature to create data visualization widgets. Canva said that it is launching its own foundational model, trained on its design elements, that generates designs with editable layers and objects rather than flat images. The model works across different formats, including social media posts, presentations, whiteboards, and websites. \u201cWe started by creating flat images with diffusion models. Omni models have taken that a step further, where you\u2019re able to edit those flat images with a lot of sophistication through prompting. But the tools have made you prompt your way to the final result, which, for a visual medium, is challenging,\u201d Canva\u2019s global head of product, Robert Kawalsky, told TechCrunch over a call. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is that people . . . want the ability to start with a prompt and get far, but also be able to iterate directly themselves.\u201d Earlier this year, the company unveiled an AI assistant called Canva AI that has a chat-like interface for generating visual content from text prompts. The platform is now making that assistant available throughout the interface, including the design and elements tabs. Users can also tag (@mention) the bot in comments to get text or media suggestions while working on a project with others. Plus, the AI tool can now generate 3D objects and allows users to copy the art style of any design. The company also added a spreadsheet product and a feature that lets users create mini apps through prompts. Now it\u2019s connecting these two products, allowing users to use data stored in the spreadsheet and create widgets from that. Canva also acquired an ad analytics company called MagicBrief earlier this year. Using its own platform for creation along with the new measurement tool, Canva is launching Canva Grow, an all-in-one marketing platform that uses AI for both asset creation and performance analytics. It also allows marketers to publish their ads directly on platforms like Meta. Along with AI features, the Australian design company announced several new products and features for its platform. Users can now create forms with Canva to collect responses from their clients or audiences as an alternative to services like Google Forms. The company is also adding email design to the platform for users to create templates and layouts for marketing or transactional emails that follow their brand\u2019s aesthetics. Canva acquired the professional design suite Affinity last year to better compete with Adobe. With this release, the company said that it is making Affinity free forever for users. Canva is also redesigning the Affinity interface to merge vector, pixel, and layout tools under one interface. It\u2019s tightly integrating Affinity with Canva so designers can create objects in the professional tool and move them into Canva. Users can also take advantage of Canva AI to generate images or designs within Affinity, the company said. Topics Ivan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

The company, founded by Kevin Damoa (pictured), has developed several hardware and software products to speed up and reduce the cost of getting shipping containers to the railhead and eventually their destination. Its first product is GliderM, a hybrid-electric vehicle with a hook on the back that can pick up and move 20-foot containers directly to the rail without the need for forklifts of hostler trucks. Read more about Gl\u012bdin our separate post. Nephrogen is a\u00a0biotech startup that uses AI and advanced screening\u00a0to develop a specialized delivery system for safely getting gene-editing medicines into the exact cells in the kidney. Founder Demetri Maxim says that after three years of development, Nephrogen has succeeded in creating a delivery mechanism that is 100 times more efficient at transporting medicine to the kidney than the \u201cvehicles\u201d currently approved by the FDA. And he plans to participate in the clinical study himself, given the challenges he faces living with polycystic kidney disease. Read more about Nephrogen inour separate post. These two companies follow in the footsteps of Startup Battlefield legends like Dropbox, Discord, Cloudflare, and Mint on the Disrupt Stage.

But he also made it clear that not everyone was cut out for this kind of viral marketing. \u201cIf you\u2019re any good at engineering, you\u2019re probably not funny and you\u2019re probably not going to be a content creator because you don\u2019t have it in your blood.

And my voice is naturally just very enraging to a lot of people.\u201d For Lee, it\u2019s part of a broader theory of social media, in which attention is the only currency. \u201cReputation is sort of a thing of the past,\u201d Lee said. \u201cYou can try to be the New York Times and guard your ironclad reputation, but realistically you\u2019ve got Sam Altman on the timeline talking about hot guys and you\u2019ve got Elon Musk going bats\u2014 crazy.\u201d \u201cYou just have to realize that the world is trending to a different place,\u201d he continued, \u201cwhere you have to be extreme, you have to be authentic, and you have to be personal.\u201d It\u2019s hard to say how well that strategy is working, though. When asked for Cluely\u2019s revenue numbers or user numbers, Lee demurred. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned is that you should never share revenue numbers because if you\u2019re doing well, nobody will talk about how well you\u2019re doing. And if you\u2019re doing poorly, people will only talk about how poorly you\u2019re doing,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI\u2019ll say we\u2019re doing better than I expected, but it\u2019s not the fastest growing company of all time.\u201d Topics AI Editor Save 50% on your Disrupt passTechCrunch Disrupt 2025 is live!

Speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt, Yakovenko said he\u2019s become increasingly comfortable taking a back seat in software development tasks. \u201cAI has been a great force multiplier for somebody who\u2019s an expert,\u201d said Yakovenko, describing his experience with agentic coding after more than 15 years developing software. \u201cNow I can just watch Claude churning through its thing and I can almost smell when it\u2019s going off the rails.\u201d \u201cIf people are in a meeting with me and I\u2019m not paying attention,\u201d he continued, \u201cit\u2019s because I\u2019m watching Claude.\u201d Co-founder of the Solana cryptocurrency protocol, Yakovenko has seen immense success this year, even as many cryptocurrencies have struggled. The system announced$2.85 billion in annual revenueearlier this month, fueled largely by crypto trading platforms. Even more impressive was the Solana coin\u2019s first exchange-traded fund (or ETF), launched the day before Yakovenko took the stage. Launched by the crypto asset manager Bitwise, the fund sawnearly $70 million of inflowsin a single day. Onstage, Yakovenko attributed the success to a growing acceptance of crypto, especially from the conventional finance industry. \u201cIf you are a back-office finance person, you actually get crypto much, much faster,\u201d Yakovenko said. \u201cFinance people deal with settlement risk all the time. They deal with banking risk all the time.\u201d Over the same period, cryptocurrency has drawn significant new criticism for enabling public bribery, particularly in connection with the Solana-hosted Trumpcoin. The coin has directedan estimated $350 million to the president, which critics see asa form of bribery\u2014 particularly in the wake of Trump\u2019s high-profile pardons for Tron founder Justin Sun andBinance founderChangpeng Zhao. But as long as Solana is an open protocol, Yakovenko has little control over the coins it hosts. \u201cI could send you an email with a link to Trumpcoin or Fartcoin,\u201d Yakovenko explained onstage, \u201cand both of those are protocols, both the email and the underlying protocol that creates that market.\u201d Topics AI Editor Save 50% on your Disrupt passTechCrunch Disrupt 2025 is live!

    "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Navan, the corporate travel and expense platform, finished its first day of trading on the Nasdaq on Thursday down 20% from its $25 IPO price, resulting in a valuation of approximately $4.7 billion for the 10-year-old company. The company was the first to use anew SEC rulethat allows public listings during a government shutdown. Unlike the traditional IPO path, which requires SEC regulators to review and grant final approval, companies using the shutdown workaround can get automatic approval for their IPO documents 20 days after submitting their price range, effectively bypassing the need for manual SEC approval. But the updated mechanism carries a risk: The government can scrutinize the documents later. If the SEC later finds material deficiencies or undisclosed issues, the company may be forced to amend its statements, which could lead to a lower stock price and even potential litigation. Despite this risk, Navan decided to proceed with its IPO, primarily because the bulk of its registration statements had already been reviewed by the SEC staff before the government shutdown began on October 1. The stock\u2019s initial decline is likely influenced, at least in part, by this regulatory uncertainty. The market\u2019s reaction to Navan\u2019s offering is being closely monitored by other IPO contenders. Startups looking to go public before the end of the year need to decide soon whether they\u2019re ready to deal with the regulatory unknowns or delay their filing until the next year. Navan has been waiting to go public for several years. The company reportedly filed itsconfidential IPO paperworkin 2022 and planned to debut at a $12 billion valuation in early 2023. The company, formerly known as TripActions, was last valued at$9.2 billionwhen it raised a $154 million Series G round in October 2022. Navan customers include Shopify, Zoom, Wayfair, OpenAI, and Thomson Reuters. The company claims that its AI-powered assistant, Ava, handles approximately 50% of customer conversations related to booking or changing flight, hotel, and car rental reservations. Navan\u2019s expense management solution helps companies manage employee expenses through features like automated receipt scanning and categorization. The company generated revenue of $613 million over the last 12 months (up 32%), with losses of $188 million, according toits S1. Navan\u2019s largest venture capital backers before its IPO included Lightspeed (holding a 24.8% stake), solo VC Oren Zeev (18.6% stake), Andreessen Horowitz (12.6%), and Greenoaks (7.1%).

The company also introduced new products and features, updates to its AI assistant, and the ability to use its spreadsheet tool alongside its app-building feature to create data visualization widgets. Canva said that it is launching its own foundational model, trained on its design elements, that generates designs with editable layers and objects rather than flat images. The model works across different formats, including social media posts, presentations, whiteboards, and websites. \u201cWe started by creating flat images with diffusion models. Omni models have taken that a step further, where you\u2019re able to edit those flat images with a lot of sophistication through prompting. But the tools have made you prompt your way to the final result, which, for a visual medium, is challenging,\u201d Canva\u2019s global head of product, Robert Kawalsky, told TechCrunch over a call. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is that people . . . want the ability to start with a prompt and get far, but also be able to iterate directly themselves.\u201d Earlier this year, the company unveiled an AI assistant called Canva AI that has a chat-like interface for generating visual content from text prompts. The platform is now making that assistant available throughout the interface, including the design and elements tabs. Users can also tag (@mention) the bot in comments to get text or media suggestions while working on a project with others. Plus, the AI tool can now generate 3D objects and allows users to copy the art style of any design. The company also added a spreadsheet product and a feature that lets users create mini apps through prompts. Now it\u2019s connecting these two products, allowing users to use data stored in the spreadsheet and create widgets from that. Canva also acquired an ad analytics company called MagicBrief earlier this year. Using its own platform for creation along with the new measurement tool, Canva is launching Canva Grow, an all-in-one marketing platform that uses AI for both asset creation and performance analytics. It also allows marketers to publish their ads directly on platforms like Meta. Along with AI features, the Australian design company announced several new products and features for its platform. Users can now create forms with Canva to collect responses from their clients or audiences as an alternative to services like Google Forms. The company is also adding email design to the platform for users to create templates and layouts for marketing or transactional emails that follow their brand\u2019s aesthetics. Canva acquired the professional design suite Affinity last year to better compete with Adobe. With this release, the company said that it is making Affinity free forever for users. Canva is also redesigning the Affinity interface to merge vector, pixel, and layout tools under one interface. It\u2019s tightly integrating Affinity with Canva so designers can create objects in the professional tool and move them into Canva. Users can also take advantage of Canva AI to generate images or designs within Affinity, the company said. Topics Ivan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

Their smartwatch shows sleep duration. A fitness app logs steps. A nutrition app counts calories. Yet few tools help people understand how all of this fits together. Bevel, a New York\u2013based startup, believes that\u2019s the missing piece in the shift toward proactive health. The company has raised a $10 million Series A from General Catalyst to scale its AI health companion, which unifies data from wearables and daily habits across sleep, fitness, and nutrition into personalized insights. The investment follows a breakout year for the two-year-old health tech company. Bevel says it has grown more than eightfold within the past year and now reaches over 100,000 daily active users, making it one of the fastest-growing health apps in the U.S. Additionally, the company says the average user opens the app eight times per day, and retention remains above 80% at 90 days \u2014 rare metrics in a category where people often churn after reaching a short-term fitness goal. \u201cWe think of health as a continuous journey, not a phase,\u201d said co-founder and CEOGrey Nguyenin an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cBevel meets you where you are, learns from your habits, and helps you make small changes that compound over time.\u201d But with so many health companion brands, fromWhooptoOuratoEight Sleep, why does the world need another one? According toAditya Agarwal, a Bevel co-founder and board member who is also a partner at venture firm South Park Commons, many of these health apps rely on accompanying hardware devices that customers must buy and maintain. Because such devices can be pricey, there\u2019s an opportunity to create a product that\u2019s purely software-based, giving people the flexibility to use the wearables they already own. \u201cA $500 ring or band is out of reach for a lot of people,\u201d said Agarwal. \u201c[People] already generate so much valuable health data from our primary wearables and other everyday sources. We wanted to make something that was more accessible across a much larger set of people.\u201d Bevel users pay $6 monthly or $50 annually. Unlike typical wellness apps that focus on a single area \u2014 such as steps, sleep, or nutrition \u2014 Bevel combines them into one experience. It integrates with Apple Watch and other popular wearables through Apple Health and directly syncs with continuous glucose monitors like Dexcom and Libre. Garmin and additional integrations are in development, the company said. All this information feeds into Bevel Intelligence, the company\u2019s core software, which analyzes and adapts recommendations to each user, learning how their body responds to stress, movement, or nutrition. Bevel\u2019s story started with pain \u2014 literally. Before starting the company in late 2023, Nguyen, who previously led products at Sam Altman\u2013backed Campus, and co-founder/CTOBen Yang, who worked on machine learning at Opendoor, were building stablecoin infrastructure for enterprises.\u00a0The demanding nature of startup life led Nguyen to neglect his health, and he developed chronic back pain that went undiagnosed for months despite using wearables and seeing doctors regularly. \u201cNothing pointed out what was actually causing my back pain, not even my doctors, which is crazy, right?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when this idea came up. Everyone\u2019s life is so nuanced. There are so many small things you do that stack on each other and, over time, create a chronic condition.\u201d Nguyen says he began piecing together his health data, tracking sleep, nutrition, and steps, and realized that issues across these areas had compounded over time. Low mobility from sitting too long, sleep problems caused by his mattress setup, and sodium-heavy meals that increased inflammation all played a role. Similarly, Agarwal, formerly CTO at Dropbox and an early engineer at Facebook, had gone through his own health overhaul after years of intense work left him burned out. What helped was logging his data manually \u2014 through spreadsheets and connected trackers \u2014 to rebuild his energy. When he connected with Yang and Nguyen about what they were building with Bevel, he saw they had a similar vision and joined the team as a co-founder and board member. \u201cWe shared the same North Star, which is helping people become more intelligent about their own health,\u201d said Agarwal, who is also a partner at South Park Commons. The venture capital firm, alongside General Catalyst, invested $4 million into Bevel earlier this year in a seed round. With fresh capital and no plans to develop its own wearables, Bevel intends to grow its team and expand into additional health services and partnerships that make proactive health accessible. \u201cBevel\u2019s mission to democratize health through intelligence and design deeply resonates with us,\u201d said Neeraj Arora, managing director at General Catalyst. \u201cThe level of engagement they\u2019re seeing from users is remarkable, and it\u2019s become part of people\u2019s daily lives \u2014 not just another app\u201d that they download and forget.

On Thursday, Googleannounceda partnership with Reliance, India\u2019s largest company by market capitalization, to offer its AI Pro subscription free for 18 months to eligible Jio users. The alliance comes just three months after Perplexityteamed up with Reliance\u2019s archrival Bharti Airtel, India\u2019s second-largest telecom operator, to provide free access to Perplexity Pro for Airtel\u2019s 360 million subscribers. India, the world\u2019s most populous nation and the second-largest internet market with over a billion users, has long been an irresistible target for global tech firms. While the country has not yet seen a major homegrown AI breakthrough, U.S. tech giants increasingly view it as the next big frontier \u2014 a place to gather diverse data, refine models, and test AI use cases that could later scale across other emerging markets. The latest partnership between Google and Reliance is a clear reflection of that strategy. The Jio offer will initially reach users aged 18 to 25 before expanding to all Jio subscribers nationwide, the companies said. It includes access to Google\u2019s Gemini 2.5 Pro model via the Gemini app, higher limits for generating AI images and videos with Nano Banana and Veo 3.1, expanded use of Notebook LM for study and research, and 2 TB of cloud storage across Google Photos, Gmail, Drive, and WhatsApp backups. \u201cThis partnership will also explore bringing more delightful local experiences powered by AI to Jio users,\u201d the Indian telecom giant said. The 18-month offer is valued at \u20b935,100 (about $396), the companies said. Google\u2019s AI Pro plan normallycosts \u20b91,950(around $22) per month in India and includes a free one-month trial. Beyond the consumer offer, Reliance also partnered with Google Cloud to broaden access to its tensor processing units (TPUs) in India. Reliance\u2019s AI subsidiary, Reliance Intelligence, will become a strategic go-to-market partner for Google Cloud to expand Gemini Enterprise across Indian organizations and will develop its own prebuilt AI agents for the platform. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement will put Google\u2019s cutting-edge AI tools in the hands of consumers, businesses, and India\u2019s vibrant developer community,\u201d Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, said in a prepared statement. At its 48th annual general meeting in late August, Reliance announcedpartnerships with its investors Google and Metato strengthen its AI infrastructure in India through a newly created subsidiary, Reliance Intelligence. Reliance and Meta also committed to setting up a joint venture with a combined investment of \u20b98.55 billion (approximately $100 million), with a 70/30 ownership split. Earlier this week, Google rival OpenAI announced plans to offerfree access to its sub-$5 ChatGPT Go planto all users in India starting November 4. The entry-level tier, launched locally in August, has since expanded to 17 countries across Asia. AI heavyweights like OpenAI and Anthropic are alsosetting up shop in India, hoping to learn more about local users and grow their reach in the world\u2019s biggest emerging market. Earlier this year, GoogleofferedIndian students a free one-year subscription to its AI Pro plan. That promotion ran until September 15. India has already helped drive adoption of U.S.-led AI platforms and ranks among the top consumer markets for tools such asGoogle\u2019s Nano Banana,OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, andAnthropic\u2019s Claude. Extending free access to paid AI versions could further accelerate adoption and cement India\u2019s position as a key growth consumer market for generative AI offerings. However, it remains to be seen how India will translate into meaningful revenue for these AI companies once the current wave of free bundling offers runs its course. \u201cThrough our collaboration with strategic and long-term partners like Google, we aim to make India not just AI-enabled but AI-empowered \u2014 where every citizen and enterprise can harness intelligent tools to create, innovate, and grow,\u201d Ambani said.

Users can edit these media generations with layer edits, adjust lighting, and change colors and angles through prompts to achieve the final result they want. Users start with an element like a prompt for an image generation on an infinite canvas, look at results from different models, pick one image, add another prompt for video generation, and look at different results produced by various models. At any point, users can use the edit tools to change the look of a video. Designers can also combine multiple prompts and models to get to the output they want.

A recentshoppingreport says Americans, this holiday season, will likely turn to large language models to find gifts, deals, and sales instead of traditional search. Retailers could see up to a 520% increase in traffic from chatbots and AI prompts in 2025 compared to 2024, according to the report. For brands, that means figuring out how to show up in AI-generated recommendations, and fast. This surge in AI-driven traffic is the bet behindThe Prompting Company, a YC-backed startup helping products get mentioned in AI apps through GEO (generative engine optimization), a strategy designed for a future where AI agents browse the internet on users\u2019 behalf. The four-month-old startup, founded byKevin Chandra,Michelle Marcelline, andAlbert Purnama, has raised $6.5 million in seed funding and already counts Rippling, Rho, Motion, Vapi, Fondo, Kernel, and Traceloop as customers. \u201cOver the past year, most of the growth on websites has come from AI bots, not people,\u201d co-founder and CEO Chandra told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing developers ask AI tools for product recommendations inside their workflows, and we think people, over time, will be less involved in parts of the purchasing funnel.\u201d As AI becomes the first touchpoint for product discovery and agents eventually transact on a user\u2019s behalf, The Prompting Company believes brands must learn how to marketto agents as well as humans. What that means, according to Chandra, is that brands will need an AI-facing website, a version of their site made for agents without navigation bars, pop-ups, or marketing fluff. \u201cMost businesses still design websites only for humans,\u201d Chandra told TechCrunch. \u201cBut the fastest-growing segment of users on the internet today is AI agents and they need a completely different interface.\u201d Here\u2019s how the platform works: First, it identifies and analyzes the questions AI agents are asking by probing models to uncover specific purchase-intent queries. It then creates structured content that answers those questions and automatically routes AI agents to \u201cAI-optimized pages.\u201d TheY Combinator-backed startuphelps companies publish thousands of AI-friendly pages so LLMs can cite their answers even when they don\u2019t rank in traditional SEO. (YC has backed similar startups, including Relixir, Writesonic, and Bear.) While SEO still matters, Chandra argues that GEO is quickly becoming the priority for brands. In GEO, product results surface organically based on relevance to the conversation, not paid keywords or search rankings. This shift may also change how people buy products. Emerging protocols, including Google\u2019s Agent2Agent framework and OpenAI\u2019s partnership with Stripe, could further accelerate adoption by allowing AI agents to browse and complete purchases on behalf of users, moving them from discovery to transaction. \u201cImagine you\u2019re a large e-commerce store. Users can buy items, make returns, compare products, or search for promotions. We help our customers expose those actions to AI agents. Right now, these agents aren\u2019t yet clicking those options or accessing APIs directly, but we expect that to change in the coming months,\u201d said Chandra. \u201cOnce that becomes widespread and attribution improves, we see a path toward more advertising- or conversion-driven models. For now, we\u2019re focused on helping companies get discovered and recommended by AI.\u201d So far, The Prompting Company serves mostly fintech, developer tools, and enterprise SaaS customers. The team says a Fortune 10 company is also using its product, for which it currently hosts about half a million pages. Overall, traffic driven to client sites is in the double-digit millions per month. The Prompting Company uses a subscription model, charging customers based on the number of prompts tracked and pages hosted. The company\u2019s founders, Indonesian immigrants who met as freshmen, previously built YC-backedTypedream(YC W20), a startup that allowed users to build and launch websites in minutes with AI, before Lovable and newer entrants took off (beehiiv acquired Typedream last June). The founders also built Cotter, a passwordless authentication SDK that was acquired by Stytch. With The Prompting Company, they\u2019re trying to change how people discover and purchase products in the AI era. The seed money, raised from Peak XV Partners, Base10, Y Combinator, Firedrop, and angels, including Logan Kilpatrick, will help the company scale its platform and partnerships as AI-powered discovery becomes the new distribution channel. The startup is also collaborating with Nvidia on next-generation AI search. \u201cIf your product isn\u2019t discovered or cited in ChatGPT, you\u2019rengmi,\u201d said Arnav Sahu, partner at Peak XV Partners. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to back The Prompting Company as they build the core infrastructure for product discovery \u2014 already powering Fortune 10 companies and fast-growing startups.

This means if you lose your device, you can use methods like fingerprint, face, or the screen lock code of your previous device to access WhatsApp\u2019s backup. For years, WhatsApp didn\u2019t have an encryption layer for its chat backups. However, in 2021, Meta added a way for users to protect their backups withend-to-end encryption using either passwords or 64-character encryption keys. The trouble with both is that you have to remember your backup password or have the encryption key handy while restoring the backup. With passkeys, you don\u2019t need to look for the password or the key. WhatsApp, which crossed3 billion active users in May, said that this feature will be rolled out to users in the coming weeks and months, so you might have to keep a eye on when it becomes available to you. You can go to Settings > Chats > Chat backup > End-to-end encrypted backup to enable encrypted backups and check if you have an option to use passkeys.

Grammarly is doing something different: Afteracquiring email client Superhuman in July, the company is renaming itself \u201cSuperhuman.\u201d Despite the branding change, Grammarly, the product, will continue to be known as it has. However, the company says it is thinking about rebranding products like Coda,a productivity platform it acquired last year, in the long run. The company is also launching an AI assistant called Superhuman Go that\u2019s built into Grammarly\u2019s existing extension. The assistant can provide writing suggestions, give feedback on emails, and you can even connect it with other apps like Jira, Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar to arm it with more context. The assistant can use these connections to do tasks like logging tickets or fetching your availability when you\u2019re scheduling a meeting. Superhuman said it plans to add functionality to enable the assistant to fetch data from sources like CRMs and internal systems to suggest changes to your emails. Users can try Superhuman Go by turning on a toggle in the Grammarly extension, which will let them connect it to different apps. Users can also try out different agents in the company\u2019s agent store, which include aplagiarism checker and a proofreader, launched in August. All Grammarly users can try out Superhuman Go right now, though the company is also selling product bundles. Its Pro subscription plan will cost $12 per month (billed annually) and will enable grammar and tone support in multiple languages. The Business plan will cost $33 per month (billed annually) and will give users access to Superhuman Mail. Superhuman said it also wants to add more AI-powered features to the Coda document suite and Superhuman email clients, such as fetching details from external and internal sources to create additional details in documents and email drafts automatically. Grammarly has for the past few years made a concerted effort to increase its viability as a productivity suite, exemplified through its acquisitions of Coda and Superhuman. With this AI assistant, the company is positioning itself to compete better with the likes ofNotion,ClickUp, and Google Workspace, which have launched multiple AI-powered features in the past few years.

Speaking at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Tuesday, the Khosla Ventures founder suggested the U.S. government could take a 10% stake in all public corporations and redistribute that corporate wealth to the public at large. As Khosla put it, the idea was spurred by President Donald Trump\u2019s decision for the U.S. government topurchase a 10% stake in Intel. \u201cWhen Trump bought 10% of Intel, I wondered if it wasn\u2019t a good idea,\u201d Khosla said onstage at Disrupt. \u201cTake 10% of every corporation and put it in a national pool for the people. That\u2019s really interesting. Just take 10% of every public company.\u201d AI leaders have exploreduniversal basic income proposalsin the past, most notably in OpenResearch\u2019sextended study on cash payments, backed in part by Sam Altman. Still it\u2019s rare for a prominent investor to so explicitly endorse a national stake in private industry. Khosla acknowledged the controversy onstage but said extreme proposals were necessary to sustain social cohesion through the disruption of artificial general intelligence. \u201cI\u2019ll get critique for this idea,\u201d Khosla said. \u201cBut you know, sharing the wealth of AI is a really, really big need to level the benefits to everybody\u00a0\u2026 We won\u2019t need to do it in 15 years, but we do have to take care of those people. We will, by 2035, have a hugely, hugely deflationary economy.\u201d Khosla also cautioned that the rise of AI would also displace jobs, which would require significant societal changes. For startup founders, this presents an opportunity to build, he said, noting that there\u2019s a startup in building AI for every profession, like accounting, medicine, chip design, auditing, marketing, entertainment, and more. The VC also suggested that the nature of work would change in the AI era, as the jobs that people perform today could go away. He pointed to work like mounting a tire on an assembly line or working as a farmer as \u201cnot a job that humans should have.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s servitude to survival,\u201d Khosla said.

On Tuesday, OpenAI announced the promotion but did not specify how long the offer would remain available. Existing ChatGPT Go subscribers in India will also be eligible for the free 12-month plan, the company said. Priced at less than $5 per month, ChatGPT Golaunchedin India in August as OpenAI\u2019s most affordable paid subscription plan. The service laterexpanded to Indonesiaand, earlier this month, to16 additional countriesacross Asia. India, the world\u2019s most populous country with over 700 million smartphone users and more than a billion internet subscribers, has been a key market for OpenAI. The companyopened its New Delhi officein August and is currently building a local team to expand its presence. Earlier this year, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said India was the company\u2019s second-largest market after the U.S. However, making money from ChatGPT\u2019s paid plans in the country has proven challenging. The app saw over 29 million downloads in the 90 days leading up to August, but generated just $3.6 million in in-app purchases during that period, according to Appfigures data reviewed by TechCrunch at the time. ChatGPT Go offers 10 times more usage than the free version for generating responses, creating images, and uploading files. It also features improved memory for more personalized responses, according to OpenAI. \u201cSince initially launching ChatGPT Go in India a few months ago, the adoption and creativity we\u2019ve seen from our users has been inspiring,\u201d said Nick Turley, vice president and head of ChatGPT, in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to see the amazing things our users will build, learn, and achieve with these tools.\u201d OpenAI\u2019s rivals, including Perplexity and Google, are also looking to tap into India\u2019s large and youthful user base.

The company says that 0.15% of ChatGPT\u2019s active users in a given week have \u201cconversations that include explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.\u201d Given that ChatGPT has more than 800 million weekly active users, that translates to more than a million people a week. The company says a similar percentage of users show \u201cheightened levels of emotional attachment to ChatGPT,\u201d and that hundreds of thousands of people show signs of psychosis or mania in their weekly conversations with the AI chatbot. OpenAI says these types of conversations in ChatGPT are \u201cextremely rare,\u201d and thus difficult to measure. That said, the company estimates these issues affect hundreds of thousands of people every week. OpenAI shared the information as part of a broader announcement about its recent efforts to improve how models respond to users with mental health issues. The company claims its latest work on ChatGPT involved consulting with more than 170 mental health experts. OpenAI says these clinicians observed that the latest version of ChatGPT \u201cresponds more appropriately and consistently than earlier versions.\u201d In recent months, several stories have shed light on how AI chatbots canadversely affect usersstruggling with mental health challenges. Researchers have previously found thatAI chatbots can lead some users down delusional rabbit holes, largely by reinforcing dangerous beliefs through sycophantic behavior. Addressing mental health concerns in ChatGPT is quickly becoming an existential issue for OpenAI. The company is currently beingsued by the parents of a 16-year-old boywho confided his suicidal thoughts to ChatGPT in the weeks leading up to his suicide. State attorneys general from California and Delaware \u2014 which could block the company\u2019s planned restructuring \u2014 have also warned OpenAI that itneeds to protect young peoplewho use their products. Earlier this month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed in apost on Xthat the company has \u201cbeen able to mitigate the serious mental health issues\u201d in ChatGPT, though he did not provide specifics. The data shared on Monday appears to be evidence for that claim, though it raises broader issues about how widespread the problem is. Nevertheless, Altman said OpenAI would be relaxing some restrictions, even allowing adult users to starthaving erotic conversationswith the AI chatbot. In the Monday announcement, OpenAI claims the recently updated version of GPT-5 responds with \u201cdesirable responses\u201d to mental health issues roughly 65% more than the previous version. On an evaluation testing AI responses around suicidal conversations, OpenAI says its new GPT-5 model is 91% compliant with the company\u2019s desired behaviors, compared to 77% for the previous GPT\u20115 model. The company also says its latest version of GPT-5 also holds up to OpenAI\u2019s safeguards better in long conversations. OpenAI has previously flagged that its safeguards were less effective in long conversations. On top of these efforts, OpenAI says it\u2019s addingnew evaluationsto measure some of the most serious mental health challenges facing ChatGPT users. The company says its baseline safety testing for AI models will now include benchmarks for emotional reliance and non-suicidal mental health emergencies. OpenAI has also recently rolled out morecontrols for parentsof children who use ChatGPT. The company says it\u2019s building an age prediction system to automatically detect children using ChatGPT, and impose a stricter set of safeguards. Still, it\u2019s unclear how persistent the mental health challenges around ChatGPT will be. While GPT-5 seems to be an improvement over previous AI models in terms of safety, there still seems to be a slice of ChatGPT\u2019s responses that OpenAI deems \u201cundesirable.\u201d OpenAI also still makes its older and less-safe AI models, including GPT-4o, available for millions of its paying subscribers.

That news was on our minds as Max Zeff, Sean O\u2019Kane, and I discussed the browser landscape \u2014 includingsome lesser-known alternatives\u2014 on the latest episode of theEquitypodcast. But it doesn\u2019t sound like any of us will be making a big switch soon. For one thing, Sean noted many companies have tried and ultimately failed to unseat the major browsers due to their inability to make money on the browser alone. Of course, that\u2019s less likely to be a problem for OpenAI, with itsincreasingly massive funding rounds. Max, meanwhile, has actually tried out Atlas and other browsers that promise AI agents will do the work for you, and he said there\u2019s a \u201cslight efficiency gain\u201d at best. At other times, you end up watching the agent \u201cclick around on a website\u201d \u2014 is that something normal users are really crying out for? Plus, there aresignificant security risks. Read a preview of our conversation below, edited for length and clarity. Anthony:I\u2019m still on Safari, but as far as the search engine, which is tied to browsers, I\u2019ve actually been trying to experiment with non-Google [options] because I\u2019m just tired of seeing all the GenAI stuff at the top of my search results. I think also there\u2019s this question of: If these AI browsers take off, what does that mean for the idea of the open web in general? You can still go to web pages, but I don\u2019t think it would be crazy to suggest that a website is just going to become less and less important as more and more of our browsing is controlled by these AI interfaces and chatbots. Max:I think that this has been a big idea that people talk about a lot: What does the agentic web look like? And I think it is a fascinating question. People have tried to come up with all these solutions to work toward this future that [they] feel is coming. And I think that there is a certain aspect of it that reminds me of previous tech waves where it\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, but what is the actual experience? What is the value proposition to a consumer of using one of these tools?\u201d And it\u2019s just not super compelling today. I\u2019ve tried out ChatGPT Atlas and I\u2019ve tried out Comet and the most generous estimation of them is, it\u2019s a slight efficiency gain. It makes you slightly more efficient. But most of the time that I\u2019ve tried these things, you\u2019re slowly watching it click around on a website, doing some task that I would probably never do in the real world. I would have it, like, look up a recipe and add all of the ingredients to Instacart. I\u2019ve never done that. I think all the tech bros always say that example in the videos, and I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t know if people are doing that that much.\u201d This is just this huge gap, in the face of the tech industry right now [saying], \u201cWe\u2019re building all these tools for the agentic web,\u201d but why would a normal person use this? And I don\u2019t know. Sean:I have not used any of those [AI browsers] but that\u2019s in large part because I\u2019m still very much an old head when it comes to search and browsing in general \u2014 a lot of the work that I\u2019m doing involves looking for documents, which just naturally involves looking through different discrete parts of web pages that I\u2019m familiar with, lots of Boolean searches on Google. Maybe I\u2019ll try these one day if Google really does up and kill Boolean search, which it feels like is coming at some point, but it\u2019s not there yet. The thing that is interesting to me about these AI browsers is that we\u2019ve seen other companies try to compete in the browser space and they always lose because it\u2019s just impossible to make money on a browser as a product. And some have tried to charge up front for it, they can kind of get by for a little while, but it\u2019s just ultimately not sustainable in the face of competing against Safari or Chrome or Firefox, for that matter. What\u2019s interesting to me \u2026 is you finally have these companies that just have infinite money, so they can ride it out as long as they want, because they\u2019re not actually trying to make money on these things yet. Eventually they probably will, but OpenAI doesn\u2019t need to make money on this thing in the next year or two, they can just have it out there and let it take shape.

    "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Every few weekends, 21-year-old student Lavanya Jain opens theBlaBlaCarapp to find a lift from Noida on the outskirts of New Delhi to his home in Kandhla, a small town in northern India\u2019s Uttar Pradesh state. The 120-kilometer journey costs him about \u20b9500, the equivalent of about $6. That\u2019s a fraction of the \u20b91,500\u2013\u20b92,000, or $17\u2013$23, he would pay for a private cab. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a fast, efficient, affordable, and comfortable way to travel \u2014 and you like to chat \u2014 you should basically check out BlaBlaCar,\u201d Jain told TechCrunch, adding that he has used the app some 40 to 50 times over the past two years. Jain is one of millions of Indians turning to long-distance carpooling as a cheaper, more social way to travel between cities. That surge has made India the company\u2019s largest market worldwide, with an estimated 20 million passengers this year \u2014 up almost 50% from a year earlier. Based on that forecast, BlaBlaCar\u2019s India market would surpass the 18 million passengers projected in Brazil and its home market of France. For a company that shut its India office in 2017 after poor traction, the turnaround is striking. Growth has come largely without marketing or a local team, driven instead by word of mouth, expanding mobile internet access, and the rise of digital payments and car ownership among India\u2019s middle class. India is home tomore than 700 million smartphone usersand has seen a sharp rise in digital payments, whichnow account for over 99% of all transactionsin the country. At the center of that shift is the Indian government-backed Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system, whichprocessed about 19.6 billion transfersworth around \u20b924.9 trillion (roughly $284 billion) in September alone. Car sales have climbed in tandem,reaching 4.73 million vehiclesin 2024, up from 3.87 million a year earlier \u2014 a 5.2% year-on-year increase and an all-time high. Other factors behind BlaBlaCar\u2019s rapid growth in India include the country\u2019s limited public transport capacity relative to its over 1.4 billion population, and the steady expansion of road infrastructure that is improving connectivity between smaller towns, rural areas, and major cities. \u201cWe have lots of examples from users who say, \u2018Before, I was flying to a destination or taking the train or not going at all \u2014 and now I can actually drive. It takes three hours, and it\u2019s a pleasant ride,\u2019\u201d said Nicolas Brusson, co-founder and chief executive of BlaBlaCar, in an interview. BlaBlaCarfirst enteredIndia in early 2015, setting up a local office in New Delhi. The company soon faced stiff competition from Uber and local rival Ola, both of which wereexperimenting with carpooling servicesand marketing them heavily. (The companies would end up suspending those carpooling services during the COVID-19 lockdowns.) Struggling to gain traction, BlaBlaCar withdrew its local team in 2017. Still, the app remained live \u2014 and in 2022, usage began to surge again. Since then, it has skyrocketed from 4.3 million users in 2022 to a projected 20 million this year. BlaBlaCar has averaged about 1.1 million monthly active users in India this year, peaking at around 1.5 million in August. Roughly three-quarters are passengers, while the remaining 25% are drivers. India now accounts for about 33% of BlaBlaCar\u2019s global carpool passengers, the company said. Trip-wise, BlaBlaCar recorded its strongest growth in India, with 13.5 million trips completed as of September 30, up from 9.1 million during the same period last year. Brazil remained slightly ahead, with 14 million trips this year compared with 11.7 million in 2023, while France ranked third with 5.6 million trips, broadly flat from a year earlier. \u201cFor us, the center of gravity has shifted away from our initial markets in Western Europe toward places like LatAm [Latin America], Turkey \u2014 and increasingly, India,\u201d Brusson told TechCrunch. Although BlaBlaCar does not yet generate revenue from India, drivers on its platform earned around \u20b9713 million (about $8 million) in August alone, the company said. On average, drivers earn about \u20b9390 (roughly $4) per seat in India, with an average trip distance of 180 kilometers (about 112 miles). By comparison, average driver earnings are about \u20ac15 (around $17) in France and roughly \u20ac6.5 (roughly $7) in Brazil, even though trip distances are broadly similar in India and Brazil and shorter than France\u2019s average of about 250 kilometers (roughly 155 miles). The difference, BlaBlaCar said, reflects lower local purchasing power and cost-sharing expectations in India. Nearly 70% of BlaBlaCar\u2019s Indian users are between the ages of 18 and 34, and about 95% of activity takes place through its mobile app. Roughly half of all rides in India occur along the country\u2019s 15 busiest intercity routes, while the other half comes from outside the top 150 corridors \u2014 evidence of growing adoption beyond major metros and into smaller cities. Among the busiest routes are Pune\u2013Thane and Pune\u2013Nashik in Maharashtra, Bengaluru\u2013Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh, and several others linking midsized urban centers. Despite all this growth, BlaBlaCar is not looking to enable monetization in India anytime soon. \u201cWe are in no hurry to start introducing a fee or generating revenue in India. We are focused on generating usage, and we have the playback because we\u2019ve done that in several markets,\u201d Brusson told TechCrunch. Nonetheless, BlaBlaCar plans to set up its local office in India and have the first hire by the end of this year or early next year, Brusson said. BlaBlaCar does not view ride-hailing platforms such as Uber and Ola as its competitors in India. Brusson described them as \u201cdemand-led\u201d products, while BlaBlaCar, he said, is \u201csupply-led.\u201d Instead, the company sees people driving their own cars \u2014 or opting for readily available trains and buses \u2014 as its main substitutes. BlaBlaCar still faces some challenges in India. State regulations around carpooling are ambiguous, which has brought the service under scrutiny in some cities. Some users, including Jain, have complained that  it can be difficult to reach BlaBlaCar\u2019s customer support, which often replies with automated messages. The company told TechCrunch it operates a \u201cblended model,\u201d with an outsourced local team handling most day-to-day queries and a smaller group at its Paris headquarters managing complex issues and quality checks. BlaBlaCar introduced an ID Check feature in India to verify users\u2019 identities through government-issued documents \u2014 a tool it later rolled out globally. However, TechCrunch found that users can still book or publish a ride even if their ID check is incomplete. \u201cThis is a deliberate design choice to make it easier for new members to engage with the platform,\u201d the company said in response. \u201cID verification is just one part of our broader trust and safety framework; we don\u2019t rely on a single feature, but on multiple, layered mechanisms that work together to build confidence within our community.\u201d The company added that more than 70% of trips in India are made with drivers who have completed government ID verification. BlaBlaCar also displays user reviews and ratings and verifies accounts through phone numbers and email addresses. \u201cWe actively encourage members to complete all verification steps, as fully verified profiles \u2014 with photo and ID \u2014 significantly increase the chances of finding carpoolers. Profiles lacking these elements tend to receive fewer bookings,\u201d the company said. Some BlaBlaCar users in India also report frustration when drivers or passengers cancel trips at the last minute, sometimes even after reaching the meeting point. Additionally, the app lacks a live location-sharing feature, which Jain noted limits BlaBlaCar\u2019s use for those trying to book rides on behalf of family members or friends. BlaBlaCar has adapted its product to better suit Indian users, introducing features such as \u201cmeeting-point logic\u201d to make coordination easier. Unlike in countries such as France, where designated carpooling zones exist, India lacks fixed pickup areas. Drivers and passengers typically agree to meet at convenient spots along the route \u2014 a petrol station, for instance, or near a highway exit. The app now suggests and displays these locations using a mix of machine-learning algorithms and user input, helping reduce detours and align with India\u2019s on-the-ground infrastructure, the company said. Globally, BlaBlaCar expects to reach about 150 million passengers this year, including users of its bus services, which operate in markets such as France but are not yet available in India. As BlaBlaCar broadens its global footprint, India\u2019s unexpected rise has positioned it at the heart of the company\u2019s next phase of growth.

After selling Mirror toLululemon for $500 millionin 2020, Putnam returned to entrepreneurship to create an entirely new product, which she unveiled Tuesday for the first time at theTechCrunch Disrupt 2025conference in San Francisco. Like Mirror, Board taps into elements of the real world and the digital one. The device offers a gaming platform, designed for friends and family to gather around, like a board game. However, the game board itself is a screen that recognizes touches, gestures, as well as physical objects. This 24-inch screen is housed in a wood-finish frame. This size allows four to six people to sit around playing games, the founder said. At launch, the $500 product comes with 12 launch games and 50 game pieces. Over time, Putnam said AI will be used to customize the device to the user. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited about the long-term power of AI to personalize the experiences on the device. So you can imagine vision and voice inputs, storylines that are adaptive, dynamic environments, accessibility features \u2014 like translation and voice-to-text,\u201d she said. \u201cOver time, AI really makes anyone able to create on board. So Board becomes more than a game console. It becomes a place for creative self-expression.\u201d To create the first games, the startup\u2019s internal game studio partnered with external developers. But the longer-term plan is for more developers to build for the platform in the future. The company also plans to offer an app store where others will be able to bring their own experiences to Board. Board is backed by Lerer Hippeau, the VC firm that led Mirror\u2019s $3 million seed round, as well as First Round and Box Group. To date, it\u2019s raised $15 million and is raising a Series A. Asked how she landed on gaming for her next idea, Putnam replied, \u201cI think that play is just universal \u2026 With fitness, not everyone loves working out, and not everyone loves working out at home, but play really unites us. It\u2019s sort of this universal language that connects us and brings us together,\u201d she said.

A 2023 survey of the nation\u2019s largest school districts found thatfewer than 10%of students received tutoring. One factor is that tutoring is too expensive for many families, often costing hundreds or thousands of dollars a month. Tim Novikoff, a former Google product manager and educator, wants to change that. His startup,Super Teacher, offers an AI-powered tutoring app for elementary school students that costs $15 a month, or $10 with an annual plan. Super Teacher aims to make private tutoring accessible to families nationwide. The four-year-old startup is gaining traction. Novikoff says roughly 20,000 families have signed up for Super Teacher, and public schools in New York, New Jersey, and Hawaii now use the app. Super Teacher is aStartup BattlefieldTop 20 finalist atTechCrunch Disrupt 2025in San Francisco. Novikoff was previously a math teacher in New York City, first in Harlem and then at a highly rated public school, Stuyvesant High School. In an interview with TechCrunch, he said almost all the students at Stuyvesant received tutoring, whereas many of the students in Harlem didn\u2019t, and the difference in their educational experience was stark. \u201c[Tutoring] is by far the most effective intervention that can be provided to kids for education, and it\u2019s not even close,\u201d Novikoff said. \u201cIt\u2019s really unfair that not everyone gets this opportunity. That\u2019s why I\u2019m pursuing a mission to democratize access to private tutoring.\u201d Super Teacher\u2019s app features animated tutors with AI-generated voices that guide students through interactive lessons. Students talk to the app using voice, like a conversation with a teacher. But unlike many edtech tools, Super Teacher doesn\u2019t use large language models to generate responses. Instead, its content comes from a deterministic system designed to always give correct answers \u2014 avoiding the inaccuracies that can plague LLMs. Novikoff thinks AI tutors can have a valuable impact on children\u2019s lives, but he\u2019s adamant that AI will never replace teachers in a school setting. He refers to AI tutors as a tool that teachers can use, such as smart boards or calculators, rather than a replacement altogether. Super Teacher is only available for elementary school students, a decision Novikoff made to help his own children and because few edtech companies target that age group. Looking ahead, he hopes to expand to younger and older grades and partner with more school districts across the U.S. Novikoff previously foundedFly Labs, a mobile video-editing app acquired by Google in 2015.

    "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Most people tracking their health today end up with scattered clues. Their smartwatch shows sleep duration. A fitness app logs steps. A nutrition app counts calories. Yet few tools help people understand how all of this fits together. Bevel, a New York\u2013based startup, believes that\u2019s the missing piece in the shift toward proactive health. The company has raised a $10 million Series A from General Catalyst to scale its AI health companion, which unifies data from wearables and daily habits across sleep, fitness, and nutrition into personalized insights. The investment follows a breakout year for the two-year-old health tech company. Bevel says it has grown more than eightfold within the past year and now reaches over 100,000 daily active users, making it one of the fastest-growing health apps in the U.S. Additionally, the company says the average user opens the app eight times per day, and retention remains above 80% at 90 days \u2014 rare metrics in a category where people often churn after reaching a short-term fitness goal. \u201cWe think of health as a continuous journey, not a phase,\u201d said co-founder and CEOGrey Nguyenin an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cBevel meets you where you are, learns from your habits, and helps you make small changes that compound over time.\u201d But with so many health companion brands, fromWhooptoOuratoEight Sleep, why does the world need another one? According toAditya Agarwal, a Bevel co-founder and board member who is also a partner at venture firm South Park Commons, many of these health apps rely on accompanying hardware devices that customers must buy and maintain. Because such devices can be pricey, there\u2019s an opportunity to create a product that\u2019s purely software-based, giving people the flexibility to use the wearables they already own. \u201cA $500 ring or band is out of reach for a lot of people,\u201d said Agarwal. \u201c[People] already generate so much valuable health data from our primary wearables and other everyday sources. We wanted to make something that was more accessible across a much larger set of people.\u201d Bevel users pay $6 monthly or $50 annually. Unlike typical wellness apps that focus on a single area \u2014 such as steps, sleep, or nutrition \u2014 Bevel combines them into one experience. It integrates with Apple Watch and other popular wearables through Apple Health and directly syncs with continuous glucose monitors like Dexcom and Libre. Garmin and additional integrations are in development, the company said. All this information feeds into Bevel Intelligence, the company\u2019s core software, which analyzes and adapts recommendations to each user, learning how their body responds to stress, movement, or nutrition. Bevel\u2019s story started with pain \u2014 literally. Before starting the company in late 2023, Nguyen, who previously led products at Sam Altman\u2013backed Campus, and co-founder/CTOBen Yang, who worked on machine learning at Opendoor, were building stablecoin infrastructure for enterprises.\u00a0The demanding nature of startup life led Nguyen to neglect his health, and he developed chronic back pain that went undiagnosed for months despite using wearables and seeing doctors regularly. \u201cNothing pointed out what was actually causing my back pain, not even my doctors, which is crazy, right?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when this idea came up. Everyone\u2019s life is so nuanced. There are so many small things you do that stack on each other and, over time, create a chronic condition.\u201d Nguyen says he began piecing together his health data, tracking sleep, nutrition, and steps, and realized that issues across these areas had compounded over time. Low mobility from sitting too long, sleep problems caused by his mattress setup, and sodium-heavy meals that increased inflammation all played a role. Similarly, Agarwal, formerly CTO at Dropbox and an early engineer at Facebook, had gone through his own health overhaul after years of intense work left him burned out. What helped was logging his data manually \u2014 through spreadsheets and connected trackers \u2014 to rebuild his energy. When he connected with Yang and Nguyen about what they were building with Bevel, he saw they had a similar vision and joined the team as a co-founder and board member. \u201cWe shared the same North Star, which is helping people become more intelligent about their own health,\u201d said Agarwal, who is also a partner at South Park Commons. The venture capital firm, alongside General Catalyst, invested $4 million into Bevel earlier this year in a seed round. With fresh capital and no plans to develop its own wearables, Bevel intends to grow its team and expand into additional health services and partnerships that make proactive health accessible. \u201cBevel\u2019s mission to democratize health through intelligence and design deeply resonates with us,\u201d said Neeraj Arora, managing director at General Catalyst. \u201cThe level of engagement they\u2019re seeing from users is remarkable, and it\u2019s become part of people\u2019s daily lives \u2014 not just another app\u201d that they download and forget.

On Thursday, Googleannounceda partnership with Reliance, India\u2019s largest company by market capitalization, to offer its AI Pro subscription free for 18 months to eligible Jio users. The alliance comes just three months after Perplexityteamed up with Reliance\u2019s archrival Bharti Airtel, India\u2019s second-largest telecom operator, to provide free access to Perplexity Pro for Airtel\u2019s 360 million subscribers. India, the world\u2019s most populous nation and the second-largest internet market with over a billion users, has long been an irresistible target for global tech firms. While the country has not yet seen a major homegrown AI breakthrough, U.S. tech giants increasingly view it as the next big frontier \u2014 a place to gather diverse data, refine models, and test AI use cases that could later scale across other emerging markets. The latest partnership between Google and Reliance is a clear reflection of that strategy. The Jio offer will initially reach users aged 18 to 25 before expanding to all Jio subscribers nationwide, the companies said. It includes access to Google\u2019s Gemini 2.5 Pro model via the Gemini app, higher limits for generating AI images and videos with Nano Banana and Veo 3.1, expanded use of Notebook LM for study and research, and 2 TB of cloud storage across Google Photos, Gmail, Drive, and WhatsApp backups. \u201cThis partnership will also explore bringing more delightful local experiences powered by AI to Jio users,\u201d the Indian telecom giant said. The 18-month offer is valued at \u20b935,100 (about $396), the companies said. Google\u2019s AI Pro plan normallycosts \u20b91,950(around $22) per month in India and includes a free one-month trial. Beyond the consumer offer, Reliance also partnered with Google Cloud to broaden access to its tensor processing units (TPUs) in India. Reliance\u2019s AI subsidiary, Reliance Intelligence, will become a strategic go-to-market partner for Google Cloud to expand Gemini Enterprise across Indian organizations and will develop its own prebuilt AI agents for the platform. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement will put Google\u2019s cutting-edge AI tools in the hands of consumers, businesses, and India\u2019s vibrant developer community,\u201d Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, said in a prepared statement. At its 48th annual general meeting in late August, Reliance announcedpartnerships with its investors Google and Metato strengthen its AI infrastructure in India through a newly created subsidiary, Reliance Intelligence. Reliance and Meta also committed to setting up a joint venture with a combined investment of \u20b98.55 billion (approximately $100 million), with a 70/30 ownership split. Earlier this week, Google rival OpenAI announced plans to offerfree access to its sub-$5 ChatGPT Go planto all users in India starting November 4. The entry-level tier, launched locally in August, has since expanded to 17 countries across Asia. AI heavyweights like OpenAI and Anthropic are alsosetting up shop in India, hoping to learn more about local users and grow their reach in the world\u2019s biggest emerging market. Earlier this year, GoogleofferedIndian students a free one-year subscription to its AI Pro plan. That promotion ran until September 15. India has already helped drive adoption of U.S.-led AI platforms and ranks among the top consumer markets for tools such asGoogle\u2019s Nano Banana,OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, andAnthropic\u2019s Claude. Extending free access to paid AI versions could further accelerate adoption and cement India\u2019s position as a key growth consumer market for generative AI offerings. However, it remains to be seen how India will translate into meaningful revenue for these AI companies once the current wave of free bundling offers runs its course. \u201cThrough our collaboration with strategic and long-term partners like Google, we aim to make India not just AI-enabled but AI-empowered \u2014 where every citizen and enterprise can harness intelligent tools to create, innovate, and grow,\u201d Ambani said.

The startup will join Figma under a new brand called Figma Weave. Figma said that 20 people from Weavy will join the company but didn\u2019t disclose the valuation of the deal. The Tel Aviv-based startup was founded in 2024 and raised $4 million in a seed round in June led by Entr\u00e9e Capital, with participation from Designer Fund, Founder Collective, and Fiverr founder Micha Kaufman. Figma said that Weavy will exist as a stand-alone product for now and that, in the future, it will be integrated with the Figma Weave brand, along with the rest of the Figma platform. Weavy\u2019s web tools enable users to combine different AI models and offer users pro editing tools to create high-quality images and videos for use in product mock-ups or brand styling. Users can edit these media generations with layer edits, adjust lighting, and change colors and angles through prompts to achieve the final result they want. Users start with an element like a prompt for an image generation on an infinite canvas, look at results from different models, pick one image, add another prompt for video generation, and look at different results produced by various models. At any point, users can use the edit tools to change the look of a video. Designers can also combine multiple prompts and models to get to the output they want. The startup offers different models such as Seedance, Sora, and Veo for video, and Flux, Ideogram, Nano Banana, and Seedream for image generation. \u201cThis node-based approach brings a new level of craft and control to AI generation. Outputs can be branched, remixed, and refined, combining creative exploration with iteration and craft. The Weavy team has inspired us with the balance they\u2019ve struck between simplicity, approachability, and power. They\u2019ve also created a tool that\u2019s just a joy to use,\u201d Figma CEO Dylan Field said in a statement. AI-powered design platforms are in demand to create media generation and design workflow capabilities. Earlier this month, AI search platform Perplexity acquired the team behind theSequoia-backed design platform Visual Electric. In April, Krea announced that it hadraised $83 million across various rounds from firms like Bain Capital, a16z,and Abstract Ventures.

    "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us People are increasingly asking AI, not Google, to help them discover products. A recentshoppingreport says Americans, this holiday season, will likely turn to large language models to find gifts, deals, and sales instead of traditional search. Retailers could see up to a 520% increase in traffic from chatbots and AI prompts in 2025 compared to 2024, according to the report. For brands, that means figuring out how to show up in AI-generated recommendations, and fast. This surge in AI-driven traffic is the bet behindThe Prompting Company, a YC-backed startup helping products get mentioned in AI apps through GEO (generative engine optimization), a strategy designed for a future where AI agents browse the internet on users\u2019 behalf. The four-month-old startup, founded byKevin Chandra,Michelle Marcelline, andAlbert Purnama, has raised $6.5 million in seed funding and already counts Rippling, Rho, Motion, Vapi, Fondo, Kernel, and Traceloop as customers. \u201cOver the past year, most of the growth on websites has come from AI bots, not people,\u201d co-founder and CEO Chandra told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing developers ask AI tools for product recommendations inside their workflows, and we think people, over time, will be less involved in parts of the purchasing funnel.\u201d As AI becomes the first touchpoint for product discovery and agents eventually transact on a user\u2019s behalf, The Prompting Company believes brands must learn how to marketto agents as well as humans. What that means, according to Chandra, is that brands will need an AI-facing website, a version of their site made for agents without navigation bars, pop-ups, or marketing fluff. \u201cMost businesses still design websites only for humans,\u201d Chandra told TechCrunch. \u201cBut the fastest-growing segment of users on the internet today is AI agents and they need a completely different interface.\u201d Here\u2019s how the platform works: First, it identifies and analyzes the questions AI agents are asking by probing models to uncover specific purchase-intent queries. It then creates structured content that answers those questions and automatically routes AI agents to \u201cAI-optimized pages.\u201d TheY Combinator-backed startuphelps companies publish thousands of AI-friendly pages so LLMs can cite their answers even when they don\u2019t rank in traditional SEO. (YC has backed similar startups, including Relixir, Writesonic, and Bear.) While SEO still matters, Chandra argues that GEO is quickly becoming the priority for brands. In GEO, product results surface organically based on relevance to the conversation, not paid keywords or search rankings. This shift may also change how people buy products. Emerging protocols, including Google\u2019s Agent2Agent framework and OpenAI\u2019s partnership with Stripe, could further accelerate adoption by allowing AI agents to browse and complete purchases on behalf of users, moving them from discovery to transaction. \u201cImagine you\u2019re a large e-commerce store. Users can buy items, make returns, compare products, or search for promotions. We help our customers expose those actions to AI agents. Right now, these agents aren\u2019t yet clicking those options or accessing APIs directly, but we expect that to change in the coming months,\u201d said Chandra. \u201cOnce that becomes widespread and attribution improves, we see a path toward more advertising- or conversion-driven models. For now, we\u2019re focused on helping companies get discovered and recommended by AI.\u201d So far, The Prompting Company serves mostly fintech, developer tools, and enterprise SaaS customers. The team says a Fortune 10 company is also using its product, for which it currently hosts about half a million pages. Overall, traffic driven to client sites is in the double-digit millions per month. The Prompting Company uses a subscription model, charging customers based on the number of prompts tracked and pages hosted. The company\u2019s founders, Indonesian immigrants who met as freshmen, previously built YC-backedTypedream(YC W20), a startup that allowed users to build and launch websites in minutes with AI, before Lovable and newer entrants took off (beehiiv acquired Typedream last June). The founders also built Cotter, a passwordless authentication SDK that was acquired by Stytch. With The Prompting Company, they\u2019re trying to change how people discover and purchase products in the AI era. The seed money, raised from Peak XV Partners, Base10, Y Combinator, Firedrop, and angels, including Logan Kilpatrick, will help the company scale its platform and partnerships as AI-powered discovery becomes the new distribution channel. The startup is also collaborating with Nvidia on next-generation AI search. \u201cIf your product isn\u2019t discovered or cited in ChatGPT, you\u2019rengmi,\u201d said Arnav Sahu, partner at Peak XV Partners. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to back The Prompting Company as they build the core infrastructure for product discovery \u2014 already powering Fortune 10 companies and fast-growing startups. Kevin, Michelle, and Albert are repeat YC founders, and they are awesome.\u201d Topics Reporter, Africa Tage Kene-Okafor is a reporter at TechCrunch based in Lagos, Nigeria, covering the intersection of startups and venture capital in Africa.

That shift has helped Snabbit, an on-demand home-help startup, secure $30 million in new funding and lift its valuation to $180 million, up from$80 millionfive months ago. The all-equity Series C round \u2014 Snabbit\u2019s third fundraise in nine months \u2014 was led by Bertelsmann India Investments, with participation from existing backers Lightspeed, Elevation Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners. The latest infusion brings the startup\u2019s total funding to $55 million. Snabbit\u2019s fresh funding follows a sharp rise in activity, with the Bengaluru-based startup growing from about 1,000 jobs a day in May to more than 10,000 daily bookings. The company crossed 300,000 total orders in October, founder and CEO Aayush Agarwal said in an interview with TechCrunch. Founded in 2024, Snabbit offers a range of on-demand home services for urban households, including cleaning, dishwashing, laundry, and kitchen prep through a 100% women-led fleet of 5,000 experts. The startup operates through a hyperlocal network of trained workers stationed around dense residential clusters, promising service within 10 minutes. Currently, Snabbit serves 40 micro markets across five major cities, namely Mumbai, Bengaluru, Gurugram, Noida, and Pune. It plans to expand its presence in these cities and enter Hyderabad, Chennai, Delhi, and Calcutta very soon, Agarwal told TechCrunch. Snabbit has served more than 300,000 customers, up from 25,000 in May, and expects to add another 100,000 as early as next month. Most of its users are between 30 and 40 years old, including bachelors and working professionals. Some of Snabbit\u2019s customers are those who do not want full-time house help but prefer an ad hoc solution. \u201cWe\u2019re basically taking inefficiency in the model and plugging that, rather than saying, \u2018Hey, this was happening offline, and now we\u2019ll do it online,\u2019\u201d said Agarwal. The startup reports a 30% to 35% retention rate and projects to reach annual recurring revenue of $11 million this month. Moreover, it has a customer acquisition cost of \u201cwell below\u201d \u20b9500 (roughly $6), Agarwal told TechCrunch. Snabbit\u2019s services are priced at around \u20b9150 (about $2) per hour, with an average ticket size of around \u20b9240 (roughly $3). Workers on the platform earn between \u20b925,000 and \u20b930,000 (approximately $284 to $340) a month, depending on the hours they work. The startup has also reduced the average walking distance for its workers between two jobs from 300 meters to 250 meters, giving them more time to serve customers. Snabbit is not alone in the race to offer quick, on-demand home services in India. Urban Company pioneered the trend and was later followed by startups such asBroomeesandPronto. Urban Company now plans todouble down on instant home servicesto stay ahead of rising competition, though Snabbit says it does not see that as a challenge. \u201cIn a hyper-local business, you don\u2019t win pan India, you don\u2019t win cities, you win micro markets. And today, out of the micro markets where we both [Snabbit and Urban Company] are present, Snabbit is leading in more micro markets because we have taken a very positive strategy to build depth as opposed to build breadth,\u201d Agarwal said. The new funding will help Snabbit strengthen its presence and expand into high-frequency categories such as cooking, child care, and elder care.

When asked for Cluely\u2019s revenue numbers or user numbers, Lee demurred. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned is that you should never share revenue numbers because if you\u2019re doing well, nobody will talk about how well you\u2019re doing. And if you\u2019re doing poorly, people will only talk about how poorly you\u2019re doing,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI\u2019ll say we\u2019re doing better than I expected, but it\u2019s not the fastest growing company of all time.\u201d Topics AI Editor Save 50% on your Disrupt passTechCrunch Disrupt 2025 is live!

Each was selected to represent the best of the Startup Battlefield 200 and competed for a chance to take home the Startup Battlefield Cup and $100,000. After all that intense pitching, we have a winner. These startups were handpicked to compete inStartup Battlefield, and all of them presented a live demo in front of the VCs and tech leaders who judged the competition. After hours of deliberations, TechCrunch editors pored over the judges\u2019 notes and narrowed the list down to five finalists: Charter Space, Gl\u012bd, MacroCycle, Nephrogen, and Unlisted Homes. The final five made their way to the finale to demo in front of our final panel of judges, which included Aileen Lee, founder and managing partner of Cowboy Ventures, and Digg founder Kevin Rose. We\u2019re now ready to announce that the winner of TechCrunch Startup Battlefield 2024 is: Gl\u012bd (pronounced \u201cGlide\u201d) aims to streamline the complex, multistep process involved in\u00a0moving a container from a ship to a freight train. The company, founded by Kevin Damoa (pictured), has developed several hardware and software products to speed up and reduce the cost of getting shipping containers to the railhead and eventually their destination. Its first product is GliderM, a hybrid-electric vehicle with a hook on the back that can pick up and move 20-foot containers directly to the rail without the need for forklifts of hostler trucks. Read more about Gl\u012bdin our separate post. Nephrogen is a\u00a0biotech startup that uses AI and advanced screening\u00a0to develop a specialized delivery system for safely getting gene-editing medicines into the exact cells in the kidney. Founder Demetri Maxim says that after three years of development, Nephrogen has succeeded in creating a delivery mechanism that is 100 times more efficient at transporting medicine to the kidney than the \u201cvehicles\u201d currently approved by the FDA. And he plans to participate in the clinical study himself, given the challenges he faces living with polycystic kidney disease. Read more about Nephrogen inour separate post. These two companies follow in the footsteps of Startup Battlefield legends like Dropbox, Discord, Cloudflare, and Mint on the Disrupt Stage. With more than 1,500 alumni having participated in the program, Startup Battlefield Alumni have collectively raised over $29 billion in funding with more than 200 successful exits.

This means if you lose your device, you can use methods like fingerprint, face, or the screen lock code of your previous device to access WhatsApp\u2019s backup. For years, WhatsApp didn\u2019t have an encryption layer for its chat backups. However, in 2021, Meta added a way for users to protect their backups withend-to-end encryption using either passwords or 64-character encryption keys. The trouble with both is that you have to remember your backup password or have the encryption key handy while restoring the backup. With passkeys, you don\u2019t need to look for the password or the key. WhatsApp, which crossed3 billion active users in May, said that this feature will be rolled out to users in the coming weeks and months, so you might have to keep a eye on when it becomes available to you. You can go to Settings > Chats > Chat backup > End-to-end encrypted backup to enable encrypted backups and check if you have an option to use passkeys.

    "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Peter Williams, the former general manager at defense contractor L3Harris, has pleaded guilty to selling surveillance technology to a Russian broker that buys \u201ccyber tools,\u201d the U.S. Department of Justice confirmed Wednesday. \u201cThe material, stolen over a three-year period from the U.S. defense contractor where he worked, was comprised of national-security focused software that included at least eight sensitive and protected cyber-exploit components,\u201d readthe DOJ\u2019s press releaseon Wednesday. \u201cThose components were meant to be sold exclusively to the U.S. government and select allies.\u201d TechCrunch previously exclusively reported, citing four former Trenchant employees, that the company was investigating a leak of its hacking tools. Prosecutors now say Williams exploited his access to the company\u2019s \u201csecure network to steal the cyber exploit components.\u201d Williams headed Trenchant, the division at L3Harris that develops spyware, exploits, and zero-days \u2014 security vulnerabilities in software that are unknown to its maker. Trenchant sells its surveillance tech to government customers in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom, the so-called Five Eyes intelligence alliance. Trenchant was founded after L3Harris in 2019acquiredtwoAustralian sister startups, Azimuth and Linchpin Labs, which developed and sold zero-days to the Five Eyes alliance of countries. The DOJ said Williams, a 39-year-old Australian citizen who resides in Washington, D.C., sold exploits to the unnamed Russian broker, who promised Williams millions of dollars in cryptocurrency in exchange. The former Trenchant general manager allegedly signed contracts with the broker that stipulated an initial payment for the exploits, and periodic payments \u201cfor follow-on\u201d support. Prosecutors did not name the Russian broker Williams sold to, but said that the broker publicly bills itself as a reseller of exploits to several customers, including the Russian government.

U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said Wednesday that the broker whom Williams sold exploits to is part of \u201cthe next wave of international arms dealers.\u201d Pirro said Williams\u2019 crimes caused over $35 million in losses to Trenchant. \u201cWilliams betrayed the United States and his employer by first stealing and then selling intelligence-related software,\u201d said U.S. Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg. \u201cHis conduct was deliberate and deceitful, imperiling our national security for the sake of personal gain.\u201d L3Harris spokesperson Sara Banda declined to comment when reached by TechCrunch on Wednesday. John Rowley, one of Williams\u2019 attorneys, declined to comment. On October 14,the U.S. government accused Williams, who is known in the industry as \u201cDoogie,\u201d of selling trade secrets to a buyer in Russia, without specifying what those trade secrets were nor what company he stole them from. According to a document filed in mid-October, Williams made $1.3 million for the sale of the exploits. Williams pleaded guilty to two charges of stealing trade secrets, which each can carry a sentence of 10 years in prison. He will be sentenced in January 2026, prosecutors said. According toRisky Business host and journalist Patrick Gray, Williams is currently under house arrest in the Washington, D.C. area where he lives. Gray said Williams used to work at the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), the country\u2019s top signals intelligence and eavesdropping agency. When previously reached by TechCrunch, a spokesperson for the ASD would not comment on Williams, citing a law enforcement matter. Last week,TechCrunch reportedthat Williams had fired a Trenchant developer earlier this year who was suspected of stealing Chrome zero-days. The former Trenchant employee told TechCrunch that he never had access to those tools, as he worked on developing iOS zero-days. Other of his former colleagues supported his account. \u201cI know I was a scapegoat. I wasn\u2019t guilty. It\u2019s very simple,\u201d the exploit developer told TechCrunch. \u201cI didn\u2019t do absolutely anything other than working my ass off for them.\u201d This story was updated with the response from Williams\u2019 attorney John Rowley.

The researchers said the Dante spyware is made by Memento Labs, a Milan-based surveillance tech maker that was formed in 2019 aftera new owner acquired and took overearly spyware maker Hacking Team. Memento chief executive Paolo Lezzi confirmed to TechCrunch that the spyware caught by\u00a0Kaspersky does indeed belong to Memento. In a call, Lezzi blamed one of the company\u2019s government customers for exposing Dante, saying the customer used an outdated version of the Windows spyware that will no longer be supported by Memento by the end of this year. \u201cClearly they used an agent that was already dead,\u201d Lezzi told TechCrunch, referring to an \u201cagent\u201d as the technical word for thespywareplanted on the target\u2019s computer. \u201cI thought [the government customer] didn\u2019t even use it anymore,\u201d said Lezzi. Lezzi, who said he was not sure which of the company\u2019s customers were caught, added that Memento had already requested that all of its customers stop using the Windows malware. Lezzi said the company had warned customers that Kaspersky had detected Dante spyware infections since December 2024. He added that Memento plans to send a message to all its customers on Wednesday asking them once again to stop using its Windows spyware. He said that Memento currently only develops spyware for mobile platforms. The company also develops somezero-days\u2014 meaning security flaws in software unknown to the vendor that can be used to deliver spyware \u2014 though it mostly sources its exploits from outside developers, according to Lezzi.

From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, orby email. When reached by TechCrunch, Kaspersky spokesperson Mai Al Akkad would not say which government Kaspersky believes is behind the espionage campaign, but that it was \u201csomeone who has been able to use Dante software.\u201d \u201cThe group stands out for its strong command of Russian and knowledge of local nuances, traits that Kaspersky observed in other campaigns linked to this [government-backed] threat. However, occasional errors suggest that the attackers were not native speakers,\u201d Al Akkad told TechCrunch. In its new report, Kaspersky said it found a hacking group using the Dante spyware that it refers to as \u201cForumTroll,\u201d describing the targeting of people with invites to Russian politics and economics forumPrimakov Readings. Kaspersky said the hackers targeted a broad range of industries in Russia, including media outlets, universities, and government organizations. Kaspersky\u2019s discovery of Dante came after the Russian cybersecurity firm said it detected a \u201cwave\u201d of cyberattacks with phishing links that were exploiting azero-day in the Chrome browser. Lezzi said that the Chrome zero-day was not developed by Memento. In its report, Kaspersky researchers concluded that Memento \u201ckept improving\u201d the spyware originally developed by Hacking Team until 2022, when the spyware was \u201creplaced by Dante.\u201d Lezzi conceded that it is possible that some \u201caspects\u201d or \u201cbehaviors\u201d of Memento\u2019s Windows spyware were left over from spyware developed by Hacking Team. A telltale sign that the spyware caught by Kaspersky belonged to Memento was that the developers allegedly left the word \u201cDANTEMARKER\u201d in the spyware\u2019s code, a clear reference to the name Dante, which Memento had previously and publicly disclosed at a surveillance tech conference, per Kaspersky. Much like Memento\u2019s Dante spyware, some versions of Hacking Team\u2019s spyware, codenamed Remote Control System, were named after historical Italian figures, such as Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo Galilei. In 2019, Lezzi purchased Hacking Team and rebranded it to Memento Labs. According to Lezzi, he paid only one euro for the company and the plan was to start over. \u201cWe want to change absolutely everything,\u201d the Memento ownertoldMotherboard after the acquisition in 2019. \u201cWe\u2019re starting from scratch.\u201d A year later, Hacking Team\u2019s CEO and founder David Vincenzettiannounced that Hacking Teamwas \u201cdead.\u201d When he acquired Hacking Team, Lezzi told TechCrunch that the company only had three government customers remaining, a far cry from the more than 40 government customers that Hacking Team had in 2015. That same year, a hacktivist called Phineas Fisherbroke into the startup\u2019s servers and siphoned offsome 400 gigabytes of internal emails, contracts, documents, and the source code for its spyware. Before the hack, Hacking Team\u2019s customers inEthiopia,Morocco, and theUnited Arab Emirateswere caught targeting journalists, critics, and dissidents using the company\u2019s spyware. Once Phineas Fisher published the company\u2019s internal data online,journalists revealedthat a Mexican regional government used Hacking Team\u2019s spyware to target local politicians and that Hacking Team had sold to countries with human rights abuses, including Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan, among others. Lezzi declined to tell TechCrunch how many customers Memento currently has but implied it was fewer than 100 customers. He also said that there are only two current Memento employees left from Hacking Team\u2019s former staff. The discovery of Memento\u2019s spyware shows that this type of surveillance technology keeps proliferating, according to John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher who has investigated spyware abuses for a decade at the University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab. It also shows that a controversial company can die because of a spectacular hack and several scandals, and yet a new company with brand-new spyware can still come out of its ashes. \u201cIt tells us that we need to keep up the fear of consequences,\u201d Scott-Railton told TechCrunch. \u201cIt says a lot that echoes of the most radioactive, embarrassed and hacked brand are still around.\u201d Topics Senior Reporter, Cybersecurity Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy.

All three major South Korean telecom providers \u2014SK Telecom, KT Telecom, and now LG Uplus \u2014 have reported cybersecurity incidents over the past six months, pending confirmation from the Korean government. South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Science and ICT told TechCrunch that its investigation into KT and LG Uplus,launched last month, is still ongoing,amid a reportthat the companies may have faced cyberattacks similar tothe recent breach at SK Telecom. Back in July, KISA alsoreportedlyspotted signs of a possible hack and asked LG Uplus to file a formal report. In August, LG\u2019s telecom division initially denied any signs of a breach, even asKT reportedthatdata from users had been exposedfollowing the connection of unauthorized micro base stations to its network. KISA declined to comment. The move comes about two months afterthe hacking magazine Phrackclaimed that hackers from China or North Korea had stolen data from close to 9,000 LG Uplus servers. LG Uplus\u2019 report comes amid a wave of high-profile hacks in South Korea affecting telecoms, credit card companies, tech startups, and government agencies, highlighting vulnerabilities previouslyreported by TechCrunch. South Korea\u2019s fragmented cybersecurity system and a shortage of experts have hindered the country\u2019s response to the cyber threats.

Roberts walks through his decision to merge UNC\u2019s School of Data Science and Society with its School of Information and Library Science, explaining why breaking down academic silos is essential when the technology moves faster than universities typically can. He addresses the $38 million in terminated federal research grants \u2014 concentrated in areas like public health \u2014 and why he\u2019s less concerned about funding cuts than he was at the start of the year. Roberts also defends his $10 million annual commitment to Bill Belichick despite the team\u2019s rocky start, explaining why football revenue is essential to supporting UNC\u2019s 2028 sports programs.

The reason I came up with this is, if you look at the history of venture capital, it\u2019s an asset that\u2019s uncorrelated with other asset classes.\u201d \u201cAnd so the thinking for many allocators was you should allocate a certain percentage of your portfolio to this and more money should flow to venture capital, but the truth is that there are only so many companies that matter,\u201d Botha continued. \u201cIn my opinion, throwing more money into Silicon Valley doesn\u2019t yield more great companies. It actually dilutes that; it actually makes it harder for us to get that small number of special companies to flourish,\u201d added Botha. Botha noted that there are currently 3,000 venture firms in the United States, while there were just 1,000 when he joined Sequoia 20 years ago. \u201cWhen I joined Sequoia in 2003, there were no mobile devices,\u201d said Botha. \u201cCloud computing didn\u2019t exist. There were maybe 300 million people on the planet that had access to the internet. So the scale of the opportunity today is completely different. If you look technically at the numbers, I think for the last 20 years, there\u2019s roughly been 380 billion-dollar-plus outcomes in the industry\u201d (meaning roughly 20 per year). \u201cThat\u2019s a significant number, but I don\u2019t think it will continue to scale just with more money going into the industry.\u201d Topics Save 50% on your Disrupt passTechCrunch Disrupt 2025 is live!

Notable companies that started out as moonshots from X\u2019s moonshot factory include Waymo and Wing. Teller noted that X has a \u201c2% hit rate,\u201d which means that most of the things the company tries don\u2019t work out, and that\u2019s okay. He said X defines a moonshot as having three specific components. The first is that it needs to attempt to solve a huge problem in the world. Second, there needs to be some kind of product or service that, however unlikely, would make the problem go away. Last, there has to be a sort of breakthrough technology that would provide a glimmer of hope at solving that huge, real-world problem. \u201cIf you worked at X, and you would just come up with a teleporter, you\u2019ve got a moonshot story hypothesis, I would say, awesome, here\u2019s a tiny amount of money, go see if you can prove that it\u2019s wrong, because it probably is,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to make it work. I want you to get information about whether this is really a once-in-a-generation opportunity or not, and it\u2019s okay if the answer is no.\u201d Teller went on to note that if someone is proposing a moonshot, and it sounds reasonable, the company isn\u2019t interested, because that, by definition, wouldn\u2019t be a moonshot. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a bad idea; that\u2019s just not what X is looking for. \u201cIf you propose something and it sounds pretty wild, that has those three components that I just described, and it\u2019s a testable hypothesis, for a small amount of money, we can learn something about whether it\u2019s a little bit more crazy than we thought, or a little bit less crazy than we thought,\u201d Teller said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a little bit more crazy than we thought, cool, high five, let\u2019s put a bullet in its head and move on. And if it\u2019s a little bit less crazy than we thought, awesome, here\u2019s a tiny bit more money. Go try to find the next opportunity to kill it and repeat.\u201d Teller emphasized that in order to do moonshots, you need to have equal amounts of audacity and humility. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have really high audacity, you won\u2019t start on these really unlikely journeys,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, if you have anything less than really high humility, you\u2019ll go luminously far down that unlikely journey.\u201d X starts more than 100 things every year, and while 2% of them make it to exit five or six years later, 44% of all of the money that the company spends is on things that graduate and are \u201coutrageously good,\u201d Teller said. He says this is because X \u201ckills all the bad ideas pretty early in the process.\u201d Teller stated that people can learn innovation, noting that every single person was creative when they were children, but that we end up unlearning things that are useful, maybe even necessary for radical innovation.

The company also introduced new products and features, updates to its AI assistant, and the ability to use its spreadsheet tool alongside its app-building feature to create data visualization widgets. Canva said that it is launching its own foundational model, trained on its design elements, that generates designs with editable layers and objects rather than flat images. The model works across different formats, including social media posts, presentations, whiteboards, and websites. \u201cWe started by creating flat images with diffusion models. Omni models have taken that a step further, where you\u2019re able to edit those flat images with a lot of sophistication through prompting. But the tools have made you prompt your way to the final result, which, for a visual medium, is challenging,\u201d Canva\u2019s global head of product, Robert Kawalsky, told TechCrunch over a call. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is that people . . . want the ability to start with a prompt and get far, but also be able to iterate directly themselves.\u201d Earlier this year, the company unveiled an AI assistant called Canva AI that has a chat-like interface for generating visual content from text prompts. The platform is now making that assistant available throughout the interface, including the design and elements tabs. Users can also tag (@mention) the bot in comments to get text or media suggestions while working on a project with others. Plus, the AI tool can now generate 3D objects and allows users to copy the art style of any design. The company also added a spreadsheet product and a feature that lets users create mini apps through prompts. Now it\u2019s connecting these two products, allowing users to use data stored in the spreadsheet and create widgets from that. Canva also acquired an ad analytics company called MagicBrief earlier this year. Using its own platform for creation along with the new measurement tool, Canva is launching Canva Grow, an all-in-one marketing platform that uses AI for both asset creation and performance analytics. It also allows marketers to publish their ads directly on platforms like Meta. Along with AI features, the Australian design company announced several new products and features for its platform. Users can now create forms with Canva to collect responses from their clients or audiences as an alternative to services like Google Forms. The company is also adding email design to the platform for users to create templates and layouts for marketing or transactional emails that follow their brand\u2019s aesthetics. Canva acquired the professional design suite Affinity last year to better compete with Adobe. With this release, the company said that it is making Affinity free forever for users. Canva is also redesigning the Affinity interface to merge vector, pixel, and layout tools under one interface. It\u2019s tightly integrating Affinity with Canva so designers can create objects in the professional tool and move them into Canva. Users can also take advantage of Canva AI to generate images or designs within Affinity, the company said. Topics Ivan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

One new feature, reply approvals, will allow you to decide which replies from other users will appear on your posts \u2014 before anyone else can see them. While Threads, like other social networks, already offers tools that let you limit replies to people you follow, your followers, or people you mention, the new feature allows you to keep your replies open to all without the negative consequences of having discussions derailed. As the company explains, these tools will help you \u201cset the tone of the conversation,\u201d and give users more choice. It\u2019s a unique way to balance users\u2019 interest in engaging in more public conversations, but one where the poster \u2014 not those replying \u2014 still has the power.

The startup will join Figma under a new brand called Figma Weave. Figma said that 20 people from Weavy will join the company but didn\u2019t disclose the valuation of the deal. The Tel Aviv-based startup was founded in 2024 and raised $4 million in a seed round in June led by Entr\u00e9e Capital, with participation from Designer Fund, Founder Collective, and Fiverr founder Micha Kaufman. Figma said that Weavy will exist as a stand-alone product for now and that, in the future, it will be integrated with the Figma Weave brand, along with the rest of the Figma platform. Weavy\u2019s web tools enable users to combine different AI models and offer users pro editing tools to create high-quality images and videos for use in product mock-ups or brand styling. Users can edit these media generations with layer edits, adjust lighting, and change colors and angles through prompts to achieve the final result they want. Users start with an element like a prompt for an image generation on an infinite canvas, look at results from different models, pick one image, add another prompt for video generation, and look at different results produced by various models. At any point, users can use the edit tools to change the look of a video. Designers can also combine multiple prompts and models to get to the output they want. The startup offers different models such as Seedance, Sora, and Veo for video, and Flux, Ideogram, Nano Banana, and Seedream for image generation. \u201cThis node-based approach brings a new level of craft and control to AI generation. Outputs can be branched, remixed, and refined, combining creative exploration with iteration and craft. The Weavy team has inspired us with the balance they\u2019ve struck between simplicity, approachability, and power. They\u2019ve also created a tool that\u2019s just a joy to use,\u201d Figma CEO Dylan Field said in a statement. AI-powered design platforms are in demand to create media generation and design workflow capabilities.

This means if you lose your device, you can use methods like fingerprint, face, or the screen lock code of your previous device to access WhatsApp\u2019s backup. For years, WhatsApp didn\u2019t have an encryption layer for its chat backups. However, in 2021, Meta added a way for users to protect their backups withend-to-end encryption using either passwords or 64-character encryption keys. The trouble with both is that you have to remember your backup password or have the encryption key handy while restoring the backup. With passkeys, you don\u2019t need to look for the password or the key. WhatsApp, which crossed3 billion active users in May, said that this feature will be rolled out to users in the coming weeks and months, so you might have to keep a eye on when it becomes available to you. You can go to Settings > Chats > Chat backup > End-to-end encrypted backup to enable encrypted backups and check if you have an option to use passkeys.

    "content": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us IntrCity SmartBus, a tech-enabled intercity bus platform in India, has raised $30 million in funding to expand its network across smaller cities and towns in the South Asian nation. The all-equity Series D round, led by A91 Partners, values the Noida-based startup at $140 million post-money. Intercity travel is accelerating in India as more people migrate from smaller towns to metropolitan cities for work and education. To meet this demand, New Delhi has significantly expanded the country\u2019s highway infrastructure. The national highway network hasincreased by over 60%in the past decade, from 56,723 miles to 90,847 miles, according to Indian government data. Railways, while extensive, remain capacity-constrained and cannot keep pace with rising interstate travel demand. That makes long-distance road travel a crucial alternative. Yet, state-run intercity bus services are limited and often fall short on reliability and comfort \u2014 a gapIntrCity SmartBusaims to fill. Unlike traditional operators, IntrCity SmartBus runs on an asset-light model by partnering with local bus owners and equipping their vehicles with proprietary hardware for real-time tracking, co-founder and president Kapil Raizada said in an interview. The startup also centralizes ticket booking and route planning through its digital platform, which helps determine service frequency, pickup points, boarding stations, and even seat configurations based on demand. To ensure safety and consistency, IntrCity places trained personnel \u2014 called \u201ccaptains\u201d \u2014 on board each bus, Raizada told TechCrunch. Most vehicles feature washrooms, and the company has also set up air-conditioned boarding lounges staffed with crew to improve the pre-departure experience. \u201cAll our buses are cloud-connected,\u201d he noted. \u201cThere is a bus operating system, which we have built up in-house, which monitors and manages a lot of parameters, including the CCTV, sound, and temperature levels.\u201d Founded in 2019, IntrCity SmartBus began as an online train ticketing platform under the RailYatri brand. That entry point gave the team early insights into intercity travel behavior and unmet demand in road-based mobility, Raizada said. Today, RailYatri contributes just around 10% of the startup\u2019s total revenue, while the SmartBus business accounts for the remaining 90%, he added. IntrCity SmartBus operates around 600 daily bus trips, transporting between 20,000 and 25,000 passengers each day \u2014 nearly 700,000 per month. The platform works with more than 50 local bus operators and runs trips averaging over 311 miles each. About 95% of its services are overnight, catering primarily to nondiscretionary travel needs such as work, education, or essential appointments. The startup\u2019s typical passengers are between 20 and 45 years old, including small-business owners, trainers, government officials, sales professionals, and students. The startup follows a hub-and-spoke model and has identified 15 to 16 key economic hubs across India. It operates in 13 to 14 of these hubs, spanning 15 states. The network covers all of northern India \u2014 from Jammu to Uttarakhand \u2014 and much of the south, including Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh. \u201cA lot of data crunching goes into understanding what the consumer needs,\u201d said Manish Rathi, co-founder and CEO of IntrCity SmartBus. \u201cThis includes decisions like what kind of layout a bus should have \u2014 should it be a full sleeper, or a hybrid with both sleepers and seats?\u201d IntrCity SmartBus grew its revenue by 67% year-over-year to \u20b95 billion (approximately $57 million) in the last fiscal year. The startup projects revenue to surpass \u20b97 billion (around $79 million) in the current year. It has been \u201cEBITDA-positive\u201d for the past couple of years and aims to become fully profitable this year. With the latest funding, the startup plans to go \u201cdeeper and wider\u201d through the country and enhance customer experience and safety, as well as upgrade its fleet management technology. \u201cOne of the bigger challenges in bus mobility across the country [is] that people have concerns about busses. It is seen as a lesser cousin to trains and flights,\u201d Raizada told TechCrunch. \u201cWe want to make busses the preferred mode of travel in India.\u201d More than 223 million intercity journeys were made in India in the financial year 2025, according to arecent reportby online bus ticketing platform redBus. The sector added over 72,000 new intercity routes last year, along with approximately 6,400 new buses \u2014 expanding capacity by an estimated 265,000 daily seats. Alongside IntrCity SmartBus, India is seeing a wave of new-age intercity bus startups such as Zingbus, LeafyBus, and Fresh Bus. European giant FlixBus alsoentered the Indian marketearly last year, signaling growing traction in the space. Still, IntrCity views competition as secondary to execution. \u201cIndia is a very different beast when it comes to road travel. If something is going to go wrong, it will go wrong,\u201d Rathi said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a network-first company. We\u2019re an operational-excellence-first company.\u201d Topics Reporter Jagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

And, he said \u201cwe welcome others.\u201d Lurie was quick to say that safety comes first, adding that autonomous vehicles are regulated at the state level. The California Department of Motor Vehicles regulates the testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles. But companies that want to offer and charge for robotaxi rides must also get permits from the California Public Utilities Commission. While Lurie is opening his arms to autonomous vehicles, other cities are more resistant. Boston, for instance, has considered a ban on autonomous vehicles in the city. \u201cWaymo has proven out it is a safe ride,\u201d he said, noting that the robotaxis have attracted tourists who come to the city to take a ride in the driverless vehicles. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping it opens at the airport shortly, and can take people here into the city.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be some resistance. For instance, the Teamsters Union has lobbied for restrictions on self-driving trucks in a bid to protect jobs. Lurie, meanwhile, has taken a bullish view on tech and the money and jobs it can bring to the city. \u201cWe believe in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cThe future starts always in San Francisco, and we\u2019re going to lean into it.\u201d Topics Transportation Editor Save 50% on your Disrupt passTechCrunch Disrupt 2025 is live!

The announcement was made as the last day ofTechCrunch Disrupt 2025kicked off in San Francisco. Nuro president and co-CEO Dave Ferguson, and Uber chief product officer Sachin Kansal are scheduled to be interviewed on the Disrupt stage Wednesday afternoon. \u201cThe Bay Area has long been the birthplace of transformative technology, and it\u2019s only fitting that Uber\u2019s next-generation robotaxi program with Lucid and Nuro will begin here \u2014 launching to the public next year,\u201d Kansal said in a statement. \u201cBy combining deep expertise in electric vehicles, autonomy, and ridehailing, we\u2019re laying the groundwork for safe and scalable autonomous rides in the Bay Area and beyond.\u201d Earlier this year, Uber said it wouldinvest $300 millionin Lucid and separately buy \u201cat least\u201d 20,000 of its new Gravity SUVs over the next six years as part of a plan to develop and launch a premium robotaxi service. Those EVs would be equipped with Nuro\u2019s autonomous vehicle system, and owned and operated by Uber or its third-party fleet partners. At the time, the three companies had not identified their launch market. The decision to launch in San Francisco could add tension to Uber\u2019s relationship with Waymo. The companies had squared off in 2018 in atrade secrets theft case, but have since patched up \u2014 earlier this year, theylaunched\u00a0a robotaxi servicein Austin and Atlanta. In 2023, the companies partnered to make Waymos available on the Uber appin Phoenix. Now, Uber is entering a domain dominated by the Alphabet-owned self-driving division. Waymo, based in Mountain View, California, operates commercial robotaxi services in the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, and Phoenix. The company has said it plans to launch in six more cities in 2026. Uber, Nuro, and Lucid are already developing a fleet of test vehicles. Lucid recently delivered vehicles to Nuro, which is integrating its self-driving system into the fleet for testing and validation. The test fleet is expected to reach about 100 vehicles, according to the companies. Testing on public roads will be the most visible sign of the partnership, but Nuro also plans to use simulation and closed courses for testing. Over the past two years, Uber has locked in a bevy of partnerships with autonomous vehicle technology companies, covering the spectrum of how self-driving systems can be applied to the physical world \u2014 although its deals with Waymo, Nuro, and Lucid might be the meatiest. The ride-hailing giant has partnered with more than 18 companies globally, acrossride-hailing, delivery, and trucking. This year alone, it announced deals with\u00a0Ann Arbor, Michigan-basedMay MobilityandVolkswagen, as well as Chinese self-driving firms Momenta,WeRide, and Baidu.

This is the first time Apple\u2019s market capitalization has crossed the $4 trillion mark, making it the third company to ever cross the milestone, after Nvidia and Microsoft. Redmond first crossed the mark inJuly, but its valuation then dropped slightly to $3.9 trillion, before returning to $4 trillion on Tuesday on the back of news that it hadsigned a new agreement with OpenAI. Apple\u2019s growth has been impressive: It reached$1 trillionin 2018,$2 trillionin 2020, and$3 trillionin 2022. Apple\u2019s stock has soared following the launch of theiPhone 17range, which seem to beoutselling previous versions.The company is set to report its Q4 2025 results on Thursday, October 30. Microsoft has also been thriving, thanks to demand for its Azure cloud service, which offers OpenAI\u2019s large language models as well as the computing power needed to train AI models. The company said on Tuesday that its roughly 27% stake in OpenAI was valued at about $135 billion. The tech giant reports its quarterly results on Wednesday. Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is getting close to the $4 trillion milestone, too: It\u2019s currently trading at a market capitalization of $3.25 trillion.

See All byAlex Heath This is an excerpt ofSources by Alex Heath, a newsletter about AI and the tech industry, syndicated just for The Verge subscribers once a week. To understand how Microsoft sees its role in the AI race, look at what was announced at the company\u2019s GitHub Universe developer conference on Tuesday in San Francisco. The event marked a turning point for one of Microsoft\u2019s most important but often under-analyzed assets. GitHub, which is used by more than 180 million developers, wants to be the central platform for AI coding agents. Its newAgent HQinterface lets outside coding assistants, including OpenAI\u2019s Codex and Anthropic\u2019s Claude Code, plug into the GitHub ecosystem. The timing is apt. If GitHub doesn\u2019t move fast enough, Microsoft risks beingleft behindby a wave of agentic coding tools that are quickly redefining what software development looks like. Tools like Cursor, which coincidentallyannounced a major updatethis week, are already orchestrating entire workflows for developers rather than simply autocompleting code. While agents aren\u2019t yet making a significant impact in other verticals, in software development, the boundary between helper and co-worker is quickly disappearing. \u201cWe need to have a very arms-wide-open ecosystem.\u201d Jared Palmer, GitHub\u2019s new senior vice president, joined Microsoft from Vercel just 10 days before we spoke ahead of this week\u2019s Universe conference. \u201cGitHub is in this interesting transition phase,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs to evolve into the platform for not just people, but also agents.\u201d Palmer said the goal is to keep GitHub \u201cthe home where development happens,\u201d no matter which AI tools developers choose. \u201cWe need to have a very arms-wide-open ecosystem,\u201d he told me. In addition to OpenAI and Anthropic, Google, Cognition, and xAI have also committed to bringing their coding agents to Agent HQ in the coming months. Thanks to GitHub\u2019s longtime, essential role in storing code, it has a good shot at becoming the connective layer between agents and codebases. That would mean Microsoft stays at the center of the developer universe. If it doesn\u2019t, developers could move their work and their data elsewhere over time. Jay Parikh oversees GitHub as Microsoft\u2019s executive vice president of CoreAI. The longtime Facebook CTO and Atlassian board member joined Microsoft nearly a year ago and now leads a group of roughly 10,000 people. His mandate is to rethink the entire Microsoft stack for building AI applications: infrastructure, security, and the tools developers use every day. \u201cWe need to move faster,\u201d Parikh told me in an interview this week. \u201cWe need to build better tools, different tools. We need to have that developer ecosystem, that choice, and all the things that support this new way of building software.\u201d \u201cHumans are going to start spending more time in the specification and creative process and delegate the actual calories they spend to GPUs.\u201d He sees GitHub\u2019s role as essential to that plan, which explains why Microsoftfolded GitHub into his CoreAI group in August. \u201cYou really want GitHub to be that place, that toolchain, that community for developers to really unlock this innovation,\u201d he said. \u201cHumans are going to start spending more time in the specification and creative process and delegate the actual calories they spend to GPUs, to coding agents that generate the code.\u201d As GitHub COO Kyle Daigle put it to me, \u201cA developer shouldn\u2019t have to build up memory and context in every single tool that they\u2019re using in this AI age. You should be able to connect to GitHub and have that context to determine how you want to work, even if you\u2019re using that tool off GitHub\u2019s platform.\u201d That bet ties directly to Microsoft\u2019s long-running partnership with OpenAI. On the same day as GitHub Universe, CEO Satya Nadellaappearedon TBPN to discuss Microsoft\u2019s updated partnership with OpenAI. He said that \u201cGitHub is where that billion to ten billion happened\u201d \u2014 a reference to how the early traction of GitHub Copilot, powered by OpenAI\u2019s Codex, convinced him to dramatically expand Microsoft\u2019s initial $1 billion investment in OpenAI. GitHub has always served two critical roles: it\u2019s a massive repository of open-source code and one of the largest collaboration hubs ever built. Engineers use it not only to store and manage their code, but to find jobs and build community. Microsoft may have sparked the AI coding boom with the original GitHub Copilot, but now it has to prove it can keep up with where the industry is headed.

See All byJay Peters It\u2019s dusk, and bugs are chirping all around me. I\u2019m wandering through the middle of a big, virtual swamp toward the sound of thumping bass off in the distance. There isn\u2019t much else nearby \u2014 some trees, a couple of other players. It\u2019s mostly just me and the sound emanating from a large wooden structure strung up with lights sitting farther out into the swamp. When I finally arrive, it rises above me: the official clubhouse of the Bored Ape Yacht Club. I make for the door to head inside. Except I find I can\u2019t get access; even though the lights are on in the house, the doors don\u2019t actually open. There\u2019s nothing to do. These were my first steps inside the virtual world themed after the infamous cartoon monkeys that became the symbol of everything about the NFT craze. Even though the NFT hype has died down, Yuga Labs, the company behind BAYC and a few other NFT collections, is about to make a big new digital push with another early 2020s buzzword, a metaverse called Otherside. Otherside has been a long time coming: The company announced its intention to build Otherside after raising $450 million in fundingin 2022, with one of BAYC\u2019s cofounders saying at the time that the company hoped to build an \u201cinteroperable,\u201d \u201cgamified,\u201d and \u201cdecentralized\u201d virtual world. Yuga Labs has mostly been quiet about the project since then, finally launching an alpha earlier this year. Today, at the company\u2019s ApeFest event in Las Vegas, Yuga Labs announced that Otherside will be officially launching on November 12th. \u201cIt\u2019s basically one of the most ambitious projects ever attempted in the space, and it\u2019s finally starting to take shape,\u201d Yuga Labs chief product officer Michael Figge tellsThe Verge. The short version of the pitch is that Otherside is something like Roblox orFortnite, but with crypto: you can use NFTs as avatars to explore virtual worlds created by Yuga Labs and by other players. You can log in with a crypto wallet, but you don\u2019t need an NFT to participate or just hang out; you can just join from a browser using more traditional methods like your email. \u201cWe think that there should be a very low barrier to entry for somebody to try out Otherside, because once they do try it, it\u2019s a really great way to get exposed to what it\u2019s like to actually own digital assets,\u201d Figge says. There\u2019s a bunch of crypto stuff everywhere you look. NFT avatars, NFT plots of land, blockchain-based currency. Yuga hopes it can build a creator ecosystem around all of this, giving builders a more compelling deal than competing metaverses because these digital assets exist outside of its world and can be moved elsewhere in the future. You can also mostly ignore all of this and just run around Otherside without diving too far into the crypto of it all, if you want to. In addition to the area I explored, The Swamp, there will be a big virtual hub world called the Nexus. Some community-made experiences will also be available to play, too. Those include a shooter game calledBathroom Blitz(\u201caction so explosive, you\u2019ll be clenching cheeks the whole time,\u201d according to a description on the Otherside website) and a zombie game calledOtherside Outbreak. In worlds, you can also create \u201cBubbles,\u201d which are basically an Otherside version of a social audio room, like a Clubhouse room or an X Space. \u201cWe actually think there\u2019s a really big potential for people that want to make their own experiences on Otherside,\u201d Figge says. \u201cGoing after incumbents in the user-generated experience field, like Roblox andMinecraft, is a huge opportunity for us, because I think a lot of people might be disenchanted with that current way of supporting creators and the economic model behind it.\u201d Otherside\u2019s in-game avatars are 3D representations of NFTs that players own. \u201cAny NFT collection can submit their avatar collection to be reviewed and used in Otherside,\u201d Figge says. There will also be avatars built using a new system Yuga Labs is calling Voyager. There will initially be two avatar partnerships. One is a 300-piece collection from digital artist Daniel Arsham. Another is a co-branded \u201ctokenized asset\u201d in partnership with Amazon called Boximus that Figge describes as \u201cbasically, like, made up of a bunch of Amazon boxes.\u201d Figge says the Amazon avatar will be available directly on Amazon\u2019s website. These avatars will cost money. \u201cThink of these voyagers like a \u2018skin\u2019 from the traditional gaming world,\u201d Figge says. \u201cWe aren\u2019t disclosing pricing details just yet, but what we can say is they are meant to be reasonable and affordable.\u201d And because they\u2019re blockchain-based assets, you\u2019ll be able to resell the ones you own, according to Figge, which you can\u2019t do in other metaverse-like games. I got to run around The Swamp before writing this article. This world seemed to be a giant, 3D social chatroom \u2014 there wasn\u2019t any sort of game to play besides exploring the space and chatting with fellow visitors over voice or text. And while I don\u2019t want to judge a pre-launch virtual world too harshly before it launches publicly, it reminded me more of the hollow experiences I\u2019ve had wandering around Meta\u2019s Horizon Worlds or ametaverse fashion showthan something immediately fun and engaging likeFortnite. In The Swamp, there just wasn\u2019t much to see or do besides wander around the outside of the clubhouse (which I couldn\u2019t go inside of) or explore the swamp to see things like an outhouse (closed) and a platform by a train track (with a sign that says \u201cout of order\u201d). To my surprise, as I was walking away from the platform, a train started rumbling by, but my character ran too slowly to catch it. I found a portal that sent me flying in the direction of the moving train, but I missed landing on it and splashed back into the water. Even if we assume those sorts of nitpicky problems get fixed and The Swamp or the Nexus or Otherside experiences are filled with players, 3D environments that are primarily for socializing are usually very niche or pretty boring. Hits like VRChat are the exception, not the rule. And part of what makes things likeFortniteand Roblox so popular is that they have games to play while hanging out with your friends. At launch, and with such a focus on crypto, I\u2019m not sure Otherside will have that same pull. Maybe Otherside will develop into something more interesting;Fortnite, Roblox, andMinecraftall snowballed their way into becoming huge hits. But I\u2019m skeptical of what I see right now, and you probably won\u2019t see me on the other side. Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.

See All byBrandon Russell Samsung\u2019sGalaxy Buds 3 Proreceived a decent price drop during Amazon\u2019s October Prime Day sale, but if you held off on picking them up, your patience has been rewarded. Right now, the noise-canceling earbuds are available for around $165 ($85 off) atAmazonandBest Buy, which is the lowest price we\u2019ve seen in months. The discount only applies to the silver color, though, and Amazon shows the deal runs through the end of today, October 30th. The Buds 3 Pro are one ofour favorite pairs of wireless earbuds, especially for Samsung Galaxy owners. They feature an AirPods-style design, complete with an elongated stem that provides a secure, stable in-ear fit. They also offer an IP57 rating and about six hours of battery life with active noise cancellation enabled. They\u2019re comfortable to wear over extended periods of time, too, and in hisreview, formerVergereviewer Chris Welch noted how his ears never felt fatigued after wearing them all day. Samsung\u2019s third-gen earbuds improve upon the sound of theprior model, too, which was already great. They deliver full, detailed sound, with an emphasis on bass and treble. If you spend a lot of time chatting with family or in work meetings, call performance is also quite good. However, perhaps the most impressive feature is their voice control performance. You merely need to say \u201cvolume up\u201d or \u201cnext song\u201d and the earbuds will execute that command through your phone \u2014 no wake phrase required. As much as we like the Buds 3 Pro, they\u2019re not perfect. They lack true multipoint connectivity, though they can auto-switch between Galaxy laptops, tablets, and phones. Meanwhile, the ANC performance falls short of what you get from theAirPods Pro 3or eventhe second-gen model. That said, they offer an excellent transparency mode, and you can also take advantage of an adaptive mode that dynamically blends ANC and transparency based on your surroundings.

See All byCameron Faulkner If you choose to get an extra controller for your Nintendo Switch 2, you can spend a lot \u2014 and get a lot in return. Buying Nintendo\u2019s own$89.99 Switch 2 Pro Controller, for instance, will net you the console\u2019s only wireless controller with a 3.5mm headphone jack, not to mention great rumble, OS-level rear button customization, and a slick design. It\u2019s not perfect, butit\u2019s the total package. But it\u2019d be a disservice to you to call it a day there. There are several third-party offerings that are significantly cheaper, yet don\u2019t make too many compromises in terms of features. I\u2019ve spent time testing a handful of them, and there\u2019s a small batch of models that I think will satisfy most people, with a range of styles, prices, and features. Every controller I\u2019ve included in this guide is compatible with both the Switch 2 and original Switch (some can even remotely wake the Switch 2), as well as platforms like PC and mobile. Each offering also includes better, longer-lasting joystick technology than you\u2019ll get with Nintendo\u2019s flagship controller; the Switch 2 Pro Controller\u2019s potentiometer-based joysticks are prone to degradation over time, after all, but our picks include either Hall effect or TMR joysticks. I put my pricey Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller away and cycle in each of these candidates for multi-session tests with a mix of games for the Switch 2. I spend time assessing their ergonomics, button location, and the quality of each button press and trigger pull. I also strive to test each controller\u2019s unique functions. Most people would rather spend $89.99 on a game or two, not a single controller. We sought cheaper alternatives to Nintendo\u2019s fantastic Switch 2 Pro Controller, but we hate compromising on features and quality as much as anyone. We aim to include wireless gamepads that can remotely wake the Switch 2, as well as offerings that feature good-feeling rumble and controllers that sport a few extras, such as amiibo support. Our top picks are just as comfortable to use as Nintendo\u2019s flagship gamepad \u2014 perhaps more comfortable, depending on your taste. We\u2019ve included picks with Xbox- and PlayStation-style stick layouts, as well as one that feels similar to the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller. Nintendo opted for potentiometer-based joysticks with its pricey Switch 2 controller, which may result in \u201cstick drift\u201d later on, if its last-gen controller tech is anything to go by. Every pick in this guide builds upon that technology with either Hall effect or tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks, which are drift-resistant by design. 8 Verge Score TMR joysticksamiibo supportGreat rumble Clicky buttons are divisiveThe grips might be too grating for some Supported platforms:Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile /Connectivity:Bluetooth, wired /Connector type:USB-C /Mappable rear buttons:Yes, two /Software customization:No /Rumble:Yes, HD /NFC:Yes /Motion:Yes /Power:Built-in rechargeable 1,200mAh battery /Console wake-up:Yes The EasySMX S10 is nearly as capable and comfortable as the Switch 2 Pro Controller, yet it\u2019s $30 cheaper at $59.99. It\u2019s full of surprises, too, including the best adaptation of Nintendo\u2019s HD rumble that I\u2019ve felt in a third-party controller. It\u2019s also one of the few options that can remotely wake the Switch 2 from sleep mode via Bluetooth. Lastly, it includes amiibo support \u2014 another rare feature to find in a third-party gamepad. However, the S10 isn\u2019t a Switch 2 Pro copycat; it\u2019s a lot grippier, both around the grips themselves and on its stick caps. Button presses and trigger pulls feel different from most other controllers, too, yielding a softer press and shorter travel, which is likely to be the most divisive aspect of the S10. One of my favorite aspects of the S10\u2019s design is its swappable eight-way (circular) D-pad, making diagonal attacks inHollow Knight: Silksongconsiderably easier to execute than with a four-way D-pad. If I could change one thing about the S10, it\u2019d be the system-level buttons (screenshot, GameChat, and home). They\u2019re crammed awkwardly just below the D-pad and right stick. 7 Verge Score Incredible value in terms of specs and comfort Lousy rumbleLacks a C button Supported platforms:Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, mobile /Connectivity:Bluetooth, wired /Connector type:USB-C /Mappable rear buttons:No /Software customization:No /Rumble:Yes /NFC:No /Motion:Yes /Power:Built-in rechargeable 950mAh battery /Console wake-up:Yes Gulikit\u2019s ES Pro is a love letter to the Xbox controller, but for Switch 2. It\u2019s just $29.99, which is a steal considering this gamepad features an eight-way D-pad that\u2019s great for fighting games, Metroidvanias, and retro titles where it\u2019s an advantage to easily be able to aim diagonally (a setting can make it so that it only registers inputs for the cardinal directions, if you prefer). The ES Pro doesn\u2019t need to do much to justify its price, but it does so anyway. It features tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks that are resistant to drifting and offer improved power efficiency compared to Hall effect tech, just like the EasySMX S10. Similarly, it can be set up to remotely wake your Switch 2 or OG Switch console from across the room using its own set of strange, one-time-only instructions that you can view in its instruction manual. I\u2019ve got almost no qualms with this controller, except for its bad rumble. It just has no subtlety, rumbling in an all-or-nothing manner. I was happier using the ES Pro with the vibrations off, which isn\u2019t any fun. Additionally, it\u2019s far less complete than the S10, as it lacks built-in amiibo support and a C button for GameChat; however, depending on your needs, those omissions might not matter to you. 7 Verge Score Includes dock and 2.4GHz dongleHighly customizableComfortable for small hands Bad rumbleCan\u2019t wake Switch 2 Supported platforms:Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile /Connectivity:Bluetooth, 2.4GHz, wired /Connector type:USB-C /Mappable rear buttons:Yes, two /Software customization:Yes /Rumble:Yes /NFC:No /Motion:Yes /Power:Built-in rechargeable 1,000mAh battery /Console wake-up:Yes (but only original Switch) 8BitDo\u2019s Pro 3 is a great yet pricey Switch 2 Pro alternative with a PlayStation-style stick layout. At $69.99, it\u2019s not as affordable (nor as value-packed) as the top contenders. However, the Pro 3 offers a lot of customization, some being cosmetic, while other aspects can impact gameplay. It has a lot going for it, with TMR joysticks, two back paddles, and a total of three shoulder buttons per side thanks to new custom M buttons. Its analog stick caps can be popped off in favor of glossy arcade stick-style nubs, which were my preferred choice in fighting games (plus, they just look cool). Its ABXY buttons can be suctioned off with an included tool to swap the layout as needed, and for visual flair, each controller includes colored buttons to evoke a retro Nintendo console. Also, it has trigger locks, letting you set triggers to have a short, clicky pull or the default travel distance. However, I\u2019d skip the Pro 3 if you want good rumble feedback. It\u2019s pretty lousy on that front, to the point that I preferred to turn off rumble entirely in games. Also \u2014 and this is a small nitpick \u2014 but the Pro 3 can\u2019t remotely wake up the Switch 2, so you\u2019ll need to walk over to press the console\u2019s power button before jumping on the couch. 6 Verge Score Comfortable, sleek designButtons are easy to swap Buttons don\u2019t feel good to pressCan\u2019t wake Switch 2 Supported platforms:Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, mobile /Connectivity:Bluetooth, 2.4GHz, wired /Connector type:USB-C /Mappable rear buttons:Yes, two/Software customization:Yes /Rumble:Yes /NFC:No /Motion:Yes /Power:Built-in rechargeable 1,000mAh battery /Console wake-up:No GameSir\u2019s Super Nova is a passable Switch Pro copy that I had a tough time warming up to, even if there\u2019s a lot about it that sounds great on paper. It\u2019s comfortable, with rubbery grips and decent rumble, and it uses Hall effect joysticks. However, it has, by a wide margin, my least favorite D-pad and buttons to press out of all the controllers on our list. The underlying tech is responsive, but it feels cheap to hammer on. That\u2019s a shame, as it\u2019s a slick-looking controller with a magnetic faceplate that pops off, allowing you to easily swap the buttons around without the need for an extra tool. The rear triggers also have trigger stops, which can reduce the travel of each pull, and the two back paddles are easy to press. It even includes a charging dock \u2014 as well as a dazzling set of RGB LEDs, which you can turn off \u2014 along with a USB-A 2.4GHz transmitter that lets you easily connect the gamepad with your PC. 6 Verge Score Cute, compact designCan wake Switch 2Hall effect sticks Sticks and triggers have limited range Lacks features from the ES Pro Supported platforms:Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile /Connectivity:Bluetooth, wired /Connector type:USB-C /Mappable rear buttons:No/Software customization:No /Rumble:Yes /NFC:No /Motion:Yes /Power:Built-in rechargeable 800mAh battery /Console wake-up:Yes Gulikit Elves 2 is a compact, Sega Saturn-inspired controller I wanted to love a little more than I do. The affordable gamepad shares some of the same benefits as the identically priced ES Pro \u2014 including Switch 2 wake-up and multiplatform support \u2014 but it\u2019s smaller, which could make it a great pick for kids or small-handed folks who have a difficult time wrapping their digits around larger gamepads. There isn\u2019t much wasted space in this controller, either, as it comes with a rechargeable battery, rumble motors, a gyroscope, and an eight-way D-pad that feels nice to use. Even for my medium-sized hands, its grips turn the small gamepad into something that\u2019s satisfying to hold. I don\u2019t like it as much for a handful of minor reasons relating to long-term comfort, button and trigger feel preferences, and some missing functionality. Compared to the ES Pro, it lacks TMR sticks (it has Hall effect), the Pro\u2019s better triggers, and swappable buttons. Since I last updated this post, I\u2019ve received several controllers that I\u2019m still in the process of testing. Gulikit sent itsTT Max and TT Prowireless controllers, both of which have PlayStation-style stick layouts, TMR sticks, and adjustable stick tension, impressive rumble, among other interesting features that should make them contenders for this list. I also received two promising gamepads from the companyMobapad, the budget-friendly N1 and the more high-end Huben 2. The hunt continues for gamepad contenders that pack in a bunch of features without breaking the bank. They\u2019re rarer than you might think! For instance, PowerA recently launcheda $69.99 Switch 2 controllercalled the Advantage Wireless Controller. It features Hall effect joysticks, but seemingly lacks rumble and the ability to wake the Switch 2. Hori alsorecently launched the Turbo Switch 2in some nice colors, each with TMR joysticks. Its highlight feature is a button that can disable the screenshot, home, and plus / minus buttons. Update, October 30th: Adjusted pricing as needed, and went into detail about some new controllers that I\u2019m currently testing.

See All byCameron Faulkner If your wrist or forearm aches every time you use your computer, the chances are good that you\u2019d benefit from using a vertical mouse, like theLogitech Lift wireless mouse. This ergonomically-friendly device has been marked down to its cheapest-ever price today atAmazon, where it\u2019s selling for $49.99 (originally $79.99) in black or white \u2014 rose pink is still $67.99, unfortunately. This model has previously sold for around $60, but not since March, according to pricing data pulled from CamelCamelCamel. The Logitech Lift Vertical Ergonomic Mouse, built from recycled plastic, is made for comfortable all-day mousing. The Lift\u2019s features are much like what you\u2019d get from most other wireless mice available; it includes two main buttons, a clickable scroll wheel, a DPI-switching button to adjust pointer movement speed by default, plus there are two thumb buttons that can be programmed in the Logi Options Plus app (sadly, the app is the only way to customize its buttons). The difference here, as you might be able to tell from how it\u2019s designed, is that using the Lift pronates your hand in a handshake-like angle to relieve tension. The Lift is a more budget-friendly take on Logitech\u2019s MX Vertical, the latter of which has its fans here atThe Verge. Notably, it\u2019s made for small-to-medium-sized hands, while the MX Vertical is for medium-to-large-handed users. The Lift is powered by a single AA battery, and includes a Bolt USB-A receiver tucked into its hidden compartment (as an alternative to connecting via 2.4GHz, it can pair to up to three devices via Bluetooth).Read our Lift impressions from 2022.

See All byNathan Edwards Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed. See All byNathan Edwards Your Happy Hacking Keyboard can finally get fresh caps. While regular keyboards have an embarrassment of keycap options, Topre boards like theHHKBorRealforce R3don\u2019t. They\u2019ve more or less been relegated to OEM-profile PBT keycaps with dye-sublimated legends, in light grey, charcoal, white, or (recently) a fewmore colorfuloptions. Something as basic as black keycaps with white legends just didn\u2019t exist for unmodified Topre boards. Until now. Ursais a new style of keycap for Topre electrocapacitive switches. I firstwrote about them in April 2024, during the group buy, which was originally expected to ship in early 2025. Well, here we are, and here Ursa is, fashionably late but worth it. Preorders are shipping in November andextras go on sale at 5am Eastern time on October 30th. I\u2019ve been typing on a near-final set of white-on-black Ursa caps for a couple of weeks now, and they\u2019re as close to a must-buy for Topre users as any completely optional purchase can be. The scooped spherical caps are comfortable to type on, and the edges are well-defined without being too sharp. There\u2019s just a bit of texture to the typing surface. The centered legends are crisp and well-aligned, and reminiscent of classic SA and DSA keycaps without being identical. The stems on my sample set don\u2019t twist like other aftermarket caps I\u2019ve tried. The bottom row is fully convex, like the space bar; it\u2019s unusually comfortable and as far as I can tell it\u2019s unique among keyboard profiles in that respect. It\u2019s all just very well executed. I\u2019ve been using them onmy Leopold FC660Cbecause that\u2019s what I have; you can see them on the more common Happy Hacking Keyboardover at Lightning Keyboards. The legends on the white-on-black keycaps will be slightly brighter than the ones on my samples, according to FKCaps\u2019 Simon Tarchichi, but they\u2019re otherwise identical to the final versions, which I\u2019ll get when my preorder arrives. TheUrsa keycaps are availablein cream-and-grey, in black with white legends (with optional red or blue modifier keys), and in a limited-edition retro-inspired brown, green, and cream. There are also blank versions of the classic and black colors. Pricing for the extras is the same as during the group buy. It\u2019ll cost $80 to cover an HHKB, or $120 for a tenkeyless or full-sized board. (You can get a full-sized set of blanks for $60 if you don\u2019t need the legends.) There\u2019s also a new $8 accent kit, in red or blue, with just an Escape and Enter key. The Minicom color is a limited edition, and Tarchichi tells me it won\u2019t be restocked, but the company plans to keep the other colors available, and release new variants in the future, so don\u2019t worry if you miss out on extras. I\u2019m a big fan of Topre boards, and it\u2019s great to have an affordable, high-quality keycap option that doesn\u2019t involve taking your keyboard apart to make it MX-compatible. (Althoughthat\u2019s also getting better and less expensive in the very near future). As I said when the group buy launched, I\u2019m not going to tell you to buy these keycaps. But I did. And I\u2019d do it again.  Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.

Anker\u2019s 2-in-1 cable lets you plug one end into a wall adapter for power, while the other end splits into two USB-C connectors to let you charge a phone and a laptop \u2014 or a tablet \u2014 from a single source, cutting down on cord clutter without sacrificing speed. The four-foot-long cable features a three-foot main run with two one-foot branches you can shorten via a slider. It\u2019s also made from a durable braided nylon and has been tested for more than 10,000 bends, so it shouldn\u2019t fray from daily wear and tear. The cable can deliver up to 140W of power when paired with a140W wall adapter, enough to charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro to 50 percent in just 20 minutes. If you add a second device, the cable will dynamically divvy up output based on what each gadget actually needs. With two devices connected, the max power delivery drops to 130W when one of the devices is drawing more than 100W. Additionally, the cable can handle USB 2.0 data transfer speeds up to 480 Mbps when you need to move files, and it supports the Power Delivery, Programmable Power Supply, and PowerIQ 3.0 protocols.
